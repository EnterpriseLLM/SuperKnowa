The developer received the business requirements, they came up with a design and implemented it. A dedicated QA team wrote tests, and validated that the new application, capability, or change worked as expected, and then the code or application was handed over to the operations team to run it. In most organizations, these roles have now merged into a set of development practices that are commonly referred to as DevOps.\\nTo learn more about what is SRE, read this Red Hat article.\\nAt the same time, DevOps practices brought an expanded role for the operations teams, typically referred to now as a Site Reliability Engineering, or SRE. Red Hat defines the DevOps practice of SRE like this SRE takes the tasks that have historically been done by operations teams, often manually, and instead gives them to engineers or ops teams who use software and automation to solve problems and manage production systems.\\nNow, the SRE role, can either be a dedicated engineering position, or frequently is one that the developers take on, either full or part time. The goal of SRE is to create a natural improvement cycle, which one gets by linking the application development and operations portions. The applications can be created such that they are easier to manage and observe, while the insights from monitoring the application, can in turn identify inefficiencies, defects, and potential improvements.\\nIn this article, we will focus on how Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps can help an SRE  improve and automate their applications. To reiterate, though, while we will use the term SRE throughout this article, SRE also applies to IT Operations engineers and application developers who are supporting their products.\\nAn SRE focuses on reacting to problems encountered by the application, but also on crafting ways to improve the time to repair the application , or even better on avoiding these problems in the first place.\\nSo, what is important to an SRE? When a problem occurs, they need to have a holistic view of what is happening to their application. This means they should have a real-time view of the state of all their components, understand what is relevant in their logs or metrics, and know whether any of their monitors, such as synthetic consumption monitors show any problems. However, they do not want to be inundated with lots of different alerts going off, but rather they want to know where to focus their time and attention. After a problem has been confirmed, they would like guidance on possible solutions, and automation to execute them. Ideally though, this would be available to them before a problem becomes an outage.\\nHistorically, two factors stood in the way here: the sheer volume of data and the fact that a lot of that data was in an unstructured format. As long as there have been applications, there have been simple monitoring tools. For example, an operator would set an alert on the memory consumption of an application, and when it breached a given amount, an alert would go off. Apart from being a blunt instrument , this approach might have been practical when the operator was monitoring a handful of monolithic applications.\\nNow that SREs are monitoring thousands of microservices, this approach is no longer practical. Secondly, with the advent of AI, we now have a way to unlock all the value of unstructured  data. For example, many problems show early warnings in your logs, long before an application starts showing problems , but the problems dont have an impact yet and thus they wont fail the main application flow.\\nAs such, some of the features that an AIOps solution like Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps that support SREs are:No code changes are required. Your applications and your site reliability processes already output a lot of helpful information. Its time to take advantage of that data.\\nBring all your disparate data sources together for a holistic view across all parts of your e', 'url': 'https://developer.ibm.com/middleware/v1/contents /articles/improving-and-automating-your-ops-with-cp4waiops\\n'}}, {'document': {'rank': 1, 'document_id': ' ', 'text': 'Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data enables building no-/low-code line of business applications using data, machine learning, and optimization from IBM Cloud Pak for Data.

This complexity arises because of the number of applications, the variety of hardware and software in the infrastructure, the volume of data, and the large number of business processes that are part of network and IT operations.\\nThis increasingly complex infrastructure makes it difficult to troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly. Troubleshooting and root-cause analysis are harder with the explosion of data available from all the individual microservices. Closed-loop automation systems help transform network and IT operations by using AI-driven automation to detect anomalies, determine resolution, and implement the required changes in a highly automated framework.\\nClosed-loop automation systems enable companies to transform network and IT operations by using AI-driven automation to detect anomalies, determine resolution, and implement the required changes within a continuous highly automated framework. Closed-loop automation helps solve many problems before they even become issues.Read more about Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps.One common use case for closed-loop automation is traffic flow optimization. By implementing a closed-loop automation system, teams can automatically correct issues like network anomalies within the provisioned network infrastructure. At the heart of a closed-loop automation system for the traffic flow optimization use case are the components of IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps, which is at the heart of IBMs AIOps platform.\\nWhat is closed-loop automation?\\nA simple closed-loop implementation detects issues that could happen in the future. The appropriate data is analyzed by various predictive models, which then make a recommendation on the change to be made to the orchestration layer, which implements the change.\\nIn complex cases, closed-loop automation combines the predictive insights information with additional AI systems to determine a resolution. The AI system is trained to resolve these issues and is integrated with a robotics automation system  to automate the resolution process. If the AI system determines it has a high confidence that the suggested resolution is correct, it will invoke the orchestration engine to implement the solution automatically. If not, a trouble ticket is generated, and an engineer works to resolve the issue.\\nThe following image provides an overview of a closed-loop automation system that addresses issues of varying complexity.Closed-loop automation enables these key capabilities:Anomaly detection. Anomaly detection uses large, real-time, time-series data to analyze networks applications, database metrics, operating systems, and so on. This gives anomaly detection the capability to identify patterns and anomalies, and raise awareness toward predictive actions.\\nIntelligent alerts. In a general operations environment, multiple connected components can raise alerts all related to the same failure event. These add to the overall load and volume of operations teams. However, 20 percent of overall alert volume is false-positive. Closed-loop automation uses machine learning models to create the patterns for the series of alerts so that those can be bound to causes and known actions, and then be corrected accordingly.\\nPredictive planning. Organizations can use machine learning algorithms to predict how application and network behaviors are dependent on seasonality and other factors to ensure that appropriate corrective actions are taken, thereby permitting systems to perform optimally.\\nRoot-cause analysis. Closed-loop automation leverages data to intelligently identify all anomalies in the service path and use AI to map it to find the most likely cause for a particular incident. It makes use of various AI algorithms to ensure the accuracy of root-cause identifications and implements the required remediation steps.IT Ops teams apply AI and ', 'url': 'https://developer.ibm.com/middleware/v1/contents /articles/an-introduction-to-closed-loop-automation\\n'}}, {'document': {'rank': 3, 'document_id': ' ', 'text': \"In this blog, I will answer the following general questions about AIOps:What is AIOps?\\nWhat does a company need to utilize AIOps?\\nHow do I train AI?\\nWhat is no-code AI?\\nWhy is this important?What is AIOps?\\nGartners definition of AIOps: AIOps combines big data and machine learning to automate IT operations  processes, including event correlation, anomaly detection, and causality determination.\\nITOps teams are beginning to explore how automation can improve business outcomes through scalable artificial intelligence . Gartner found that 10 times more business leaders will rely on AIOps platforms for automated insights in the next three years. Without it, IT organizations can experience a lack of observability, become overwhelmed from manually managing data, and end up focusing on infrastructure rather than an application-centric approach. The ITOps teams of tomorrow will experience full visualization and observability of their IT environments with insights derived from various tools that focus on critical applications to support business performance.\\nWhat does a company need to be able to use AIOps?\\nTo start, ITOps organizations can determine what the company needs in business performance. By applying AI, what does the company intend to do to improve outcomes? Next, companies will need to consider if the organization has historical and real-time data organized in a way that can begin to train models, and if so, is it understandable.\\nHow do I train AI?\\nIf a company wants to use AIOps they need to establish a baseline performance, which requires that they have an understanding of their historical data by measuring the performance of their steady state using real-time data. When something bad happens to a system, like an application outage, the company can more efficiently pinpoint the issue by using insights gathered from historical and real-time data. This insightful information can help find ways to triage events or outages as efficiently as possible.\\nWhat is no-code AI?\\nCompanies don't always have data scientists, data engineers, or data centric teams to help. What if we could train AI without the assistance of data scientists, data engineers, and data centric teams?\\nNo-code AI simply means using no-code in automation training. A company can use its history and what it is doing today as a baseline to improve its tomorrow without developing code to train the AI.\\nWhy is this important?\\nAs an IT admin juggling multiple sources of data and resolving incidents manually, you need tools to help you resolve incidents faster.\\nTime is money. Battling aggressive timelines, ITOps teams need to identify solutions quickly and have those solutions work correctly when theyre set in motion. Lets unpack how this is achieved with Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps.\\nSo, what is the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps?\\nCloud Pak for Watson AIOps provides an application-centric data and intelligence platform powering automation for application, incident, cost, and security  risk management with trusted and explainable AI.\\nFigure 1: Bringing DevSecOps together with AI and automationThe goal of using AIOps is to focus on business outcomes.

By running exclusively on  and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Cloud Paks are built atop a secure stack and maintain consistency in deployment and behavior across cloud providers. You have greater flexibility to run and manage your workloads securely where you need them: on-premises, off-premises, in a backup provider, and in .Overview of Cloud Pak offeringsYou can deploy the entire set of Cloud Paks to manage your full-stack cloud apps, data, integration, automation, and management across  cloud providers.Cloud Pak for ApplicationsCloud Pak for DataCloud Pak for IntegrationCloud Pak for SecurityCloud Pak for ManagementAdding IBM Cloud PaksIBM Cloud Paks are containerized, licensed IBM middleware and open source software components as part of your hybrid cloud solution. IBM Cloud Paks run exclusively on  clusters, not community Kubernetes clusters.Before you begin:\\n Verify that your account administrator set up your  account with the Cloud Pak entitlement.\\n Make sure that you have the required permissions to create a cluster. These permissions include the following:\\n     The IAM Administrator platform access role for .\\n     The IAM Administrator platform access role for .\\n     The IAM Viewer platform access role for the resource group if you create the cluster in a resource group other than default.\\n     The appropriate infrastructure permissions, such as an API key with the Super User role for classic infrastructure.\\nTo add a Cloud Pak from the  catalog:Add your Cloud Pak entitlement from IBM Passport Advantage to your  cluster.For new clusters: Create a cluster with the --entitlement cloud_pak option. When you specify the number of workers  and flavor , make sure to specify only the number and size of worker nodes that you are entitled to use. You can optionally specify the worker node operating system . After your cluster is created, you are not charged the  license fee for the entitled worker nodes in the default worker pool. If you want to use a different worker pool for your Cloud Pak, follow the steps for existing clusters.\\nFor existing clusters or worker pools other than default: Create a worker pool with the --entitlement cloud_pak option. When you specify the number of workers  and flavor , make sure to specify only the number and size of worker nodes that you are entitled to use. After creation, your worker pool does not charge you the  license fee for your entitled worker nodes.Do not exceed your entitlement. Keep in mind that your OpenShift Container Platform entitlements can be used with other cloud providers or in other environments. To avoid billing issues later, make sure that you use only what you are entitled to use. For example, you might have an entitlement for the OCP licenses for two worker nodes of 4 CPU and 16 GB memory, and you create this worker pool with two worker nodes of 4 CPU and 16 GB memory. You used your entire entitlement, and you can't use the same entitlement for other worker pools, cloud providers, or environments.In the  catalog, in the Software tab, under Offering Type, check Cloud Paks.Select the Cloud Pak that you want to deploy, and follow the installation instructions. Each Cloud Pak requires an entitlement from IBM Passport Advantage, and has its own configuration settings. For more information, view the About tab and Cloud Pak documentation.Now you can run your Cloud Pak on your  cluster!\\nAssigning a Cloud Pak entitlement to your  accountTo deploy a Cloud Pak to your  cluster, your entitlement to the Cloud Pak must be assigned to your  account.Verify that your Cloud Pak entitlement is in your Container software library. If you don't see the entitlement, the entitlement might be owned by a different user.

Maybe you need a refresher course. ... It\\'s all ball bearings nowadays.\" - Fletch, 1985 movie\\nSadly, it is not all about ball bearings nowadays. It\\'s all about containers. If you heard about containers, but are not sure what they are, you\\'ve come to the right place. This blog post addresses the following questions:Why should I care about containers?\\nWhat are containers?\\nAre containers the same as microservices?\\nWhat is an example of a microservices application?\\nWhat is a Docker container?\\nWhat are container orchestration and Kubernetes?\\nWhat is the difference between containers and virtual machine images?\\nHow can I get started with containers?\\nHow can IBM Cloud Paks help?\\nWhere can I run my containers?\\nWhat is Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud?Why should I care about containers?\\nAcross organizations, there is a spectrum of container adoption. Many people are just learning about containers. Some companies are further along in their journey. If you\\'re at all considering containerization, it\\'s time to join the fun where you can see real business results:Faster time to market: New applications and services are what keep your competitive edge. Organizations are able to speed up delivery of new services with development and operational agility.\\nDeployment velocity: Move quicker from development to deployment. Containerization breaks down barriers for DevOps teams to accelerate deployment times and frequency.\\nIT infrastructure reduction: Reduce your costs by increasing your application workload density, getting better utilization of your server compute density, and reducing software licensing costs.\\nIT operational efficiency: Gain more operational efficiency by streamlining and automating the management of diverse applications and infrastructure into a single operating model.\\nGain freedom of choice: Package, ship, and run applications on any public or private cloud.Next steps: Learn what the true benefits of moving to containers are.What are containers?\\nThe best analogy for understanding containers is a shipping container. That\\'s why the majority of all container articles and blog posts show a photo of a shipping container. We\\'re sure you\\'ve seen the transport of those big steel shipping containers.  The shipping industry standardized on a consistent size container. Now, the same container can move from a ship to a train to a truck without unloading the cargo. The container contents do not matter.\\nJust like a shipping container, a software container is a standardized package of software. Everything needed for the software to run is inside the container. The software code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings are all inside a single container.\\nAre containers the same thing as microservices?\\nOnce you start diving into containers, it\\'s impossible to avoid reading about microservices.  Microservices is an architectural style. A microservices architecture structures an application by using as a collection of loosely coupled services, which deliver specific business capabilities. Containers help make it happen.\\nWhat is an example of a microservices application?\\nMore than ten years ago, Netflix was one of the first companies to begin using containers extensively. They rewrote the applications that ran their entire video service by using a microservices architecture. In 2017, Netflix estimated that it employed around 700 microservices to control each of the many functions that make up its service. Let\\'s look at a few :Video selection: A microservice, in a container, provides your phone, tablet, computer, or TV with the video file to play and at a video quality based on your internet speed.\\nViewing history: One microservice remembers what shows you watch.\\nProgram recommendations: A microservice takes a look at your viewing history and uses analytics to recommend movies.\\nMain menu: One microservice provides the names and images of these movies shown on your main menu.\\nBilling: Another microser', 'url': 'https://developer.ibm.com/middleware/v1/contents /blogs/what-are-containers-and-why-do-you-need-them\\n'}}, {'document': {'rank': 8, 'document_id': ' ', 'text': 'Archived contentArchive date: 2023-02-09This content is no longer being updated or maintained.

This first post focuses on integration points of the recently announced joint offering: Cloudera Data Platform for IBM Cloud Pak for Data. The second post will look at how Cloudera Data Platform was installed on IBM Cloud using Ansible. And the third post will focus on lessons learned from installing, maintaining, and verifying the connectivity of the two platforms. Lets get started!\\nIn this post we will be outlining the main integration points between Cloudera Data Platform and IBM Cloud Pak for Data, and explaining how the two distinct data and AI platforms can communicate with each other. Integrating two platforms is made easy with capabilities available out of the box for both IBM Cloud Pak for Data and Cloudera Data Platform. Establishing a connection between the two is just a few clicks away.Architecture diagram showing Cloudera Data Plaform for Cloud Pak for Data\\nIn our view, there are three key points to integrating Cloudera Data Platform and IBM Cloud Pak for Data; all other services piggyback on one of these:Apache Knox Gateway \\nExecution Engine for Apache Hadoop \\nDb2 Big SQL Read on for more information about how each integration point works. For a demonstration on how to use data from Hive and Db2 check out the video below where we join the data using Data Virtualization and then display it with IBM Cognos Analytics check out the video below.Apache Knox Gateway\\nTo truly be secure, a Hadoop cluster needs Kerberos. However, Kerberos requires a client-side library and complex client-side configuration. This is where the Apache Knox Gateway  comes in. By encapsulating Kerberos, Knox eliminates the need for client software or client configuration and, thus, simplifies the access model. Knox integrates with identity management and SSO systems, such as Active Directory and LDAP, to allow identities from these systems to be used for access to Cloudera clusters.Knox dashboard showing the list of supported services\\nCloudera services such as Impala, Hive, and HDFS can be configured with Knox, allowing JDBC connections to easily be created in IBM Cloud Pak for Data.Creating a JDBC connection to Impala via KnoxList of connections on IBM Cloud Pak for Data\\nExecution Engine for Apache Hadoop\\nThe Execution Engine for Apache Hadoop service is installed on both IBM Cloud Pak for Data and on the worker nodes of a Cloudera Data Platform deployment. Execution Engine for Hadoop allows users to:Browse remote Hadoop data  through platform-level connections\\nCleanse and shape remote Hadoop data  with Data Refinery\\nRun a Jupyter notebook session on the remote Hadoop system\\nAccess Hadoop systems with basic utilities from RStudio and Jupyter notebooksAfter installing and configuring the services on IBM Cloud Pak for Data and Cloudera Data Platform, you can create platform-level connections to HDFS, Impala, and Hive.Execution Engine for Hadoop connection options\\nOnce a connection has been established, data from HDFS, Impala, or Hive can be browsed and imported.Browsing through an HDFS connection made via Execution Engine for Hadoop\\nData residing in HDFS, Impala or Hive can be cleaned and modified through Data Refinery on IBM Cloud Pak for Data.Data Refinery allows for operations to be run on data\\nThe Hadoop Execution Engine also allows for Jupyter notebook sessions to connect to a remote Hadoop system.Jupyter notebook connecting to a remote HDFS\\nDb2 Big SQL\\nThe Db2 Big SQL service is installed on IBM Cloud Pak for Data and is configured to communicate with a Cloudera Data Platform deployment.

      "[May 23, 01:19:46] #> Input: $ It used to be that the developer and operations roles were fully separated. The developer received the business requirements, they came up with a design and implemented it. A dedicated QA team wrote tests, and validated that the new application, capability, or change worked as expected, and then the code or application was handed over to the operations team to run it. In most organizations, these roles have now merged into a set of development practices that are commonly referred to as DevOps.\n",
      "To learn more about what is SRE, read this Red Hat article.\n",
      "At the same time, DevOps practices brought an expanded role for the operations teams, typically referred to now as a Site Reliability Engineering, or SRE. Red Hat defines the DevOps practice of SRE like this SRE takes the tasks that have historically been done by operations teams, often manually, and instead gives them to engineers or ops teams who use software and automation to solve problems and manage production systems.\n",
      "Now, the SRE role, can either be a dedicated engineering position, or frequently is one that the developers take on, either full or part time. The goal of SRE is to create a natural improvement cycle, which one gets by linking the application development and operations portions. The applications can be created such that they are easier to manage and observe, while the insights from monitoring the application, can in turn identify inefficiencies, defects, and potential improvements.\n",
      "In this article, we will focus on how Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps can help an SRE  improve and automate their applications. To reiterate, though, while we will use the term SRE throughout this article, SRE also applies to IT Operations engineers and application developers who are supporting their products.\n",
      "An SRE focuses on reacting to problems encountered by the application, but also on crafting ways to improve the time to repair the application , or even better on avoiding these problems in the first place.\n",
      "So, what is important to an SRE? When a problem occurs, they need to have a holistic view of what is happening to their application. This means they should have a real-time view of the state of all their components, understand what is relevant in their logs or metrics, and know whether any of their monitors, such as synthetic consumption monitors show any problems. However, they do not want to be inundated with lots of different alerts going off, but rather they want to know where to focus their time and attention. After a problem has been confirmed, they would like guidance on possible solutions, and automation to execute them. Ideally though, this would be available to them before a problem becomes an outage.\n",
      "Historically, two factors stood in the way here: the sheer volume of data and the fact that a lot of that data was in an unstructured format. As long as there have been applications, there have been simple monitoring tools. For example, an operator would set an alert on the memory consumption of an application, and when it breached a given amount, an alert would go off. Apart from being a blunt instrument , this approach might have been practical when the operator was monitoring a handful of monolithic applications.\n",
      "Now that SREs are monitoring thousands of microservices, this approach is no longer practical. Secondly, with the advent of AI, we now have a way to unlock all the value of unstructured  data. For example, many problems show early warnings in your logs, long before an application starts showing problems , but the problems dont have an impact yet and thus they wont fail the main application flow.\n",
      "As such, some of the features that an AIOps solution like Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps that support SREs are:No code changes are required. Your applications and your site reliability processes already output a lot of helpful information. Its time to take advantage of that data.\n",

If you heard about containers, but are not sure what they are, you\\'ve come to the right place. This blog post addresses the following questions:Why should I care about containers?\\nWhat are containers?\\nAre containers the same as microservices?\\nWhat is an example of a microservices application?\\nWhat is a Docker container?\\nWhat are container orchestration and Kubernetes?\\nWhat is the difference between containers and virtual machine images?\\nHow can I get started with containers?\\nHow can IBM Cloud Paks help?\\nWhere can I run my containers?\\nWhat is Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud?Why should I care about containers?\\nAcross organizations, there is a spectrum of container adoption. Many people are just learning about containers. Some companies are further along in their journey. If you\\'re at all considering containerization, it\\'s time to join the fun where you can see real business results:Faster time to market: New applications and services are what keep your competitive edge. Organizations are able to speed up delivery of new services with development and operational agility.\\nDeployment velocity: Move quicker from development to deployment. Containerization breaks down barriers for DevOps teams to accelerate deployment times and frequency.\\nIT infrastructure reduction: Reduce your costs by increasing your application workload density, getting better utilization of your server compute density, and reducing software licensing costs.\\nIT operational efficiency: Gain more operational efficiency by streamlining and automating the management of diverse applications and infrastructure into a single operating model.\\nGain freedom of choice: Package, ship, and run applications on any public or private cloud.Next steps: Learn what the true benefits of moving to containers are.What are containers?\\nThe best analogy for understanding containers is a shipping container. That\\'s why the majority of all container articles and blog posts show a photo of a shipping container. We\\'re sure you\\'ve seen the transport of those big steel shipping containers.  The shipping industry standardized on a consistent size container. Now, the same container can move from a ship to a train to a truck without unloading the cargo. The container contents do not matter.\\nJust like a shipping container, a software container is a standardized package of software. Everything needed for the software to run is inside the container. The software code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings are all inside a single container.\\nAre containers the same thing as microservices?\\nOnce you start diving into containers, it\\'s impossible to avoid reading about microservices.  Microservices is an architectural style. A microservices architecture structures an application by using as a collection of loosely coupled services, which deliver specific business capabilities. Containers help make it happen.\\nWhat is an example of a microservices application?\\nMore than ten years ago, Netflix was one of the first companies to begin using containers extensively. They rewrote the applications that ran their entire video service by using a microservices architecture. In 2017, Netflix estimated that it employed around 700 microservices to control each of the many functions that make up its service.

This complexity arises because of the number of applications, the variety of hardware and software in the infrastructure, the volume of data, and the large number of business processes that are part of network and IT operations.\\nThis increasingly complex infrastructure makes it difficult to troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly. Troubleshooting and root-cause analysis are harder with the explosion of data available from all the individual microservices. Closed-loop automation systems help transform network and IT operations by using AI-driven automation to detect anomalies, determine resolution, and implement the required changes in a highly automated framework.\\nClosed-loop automation systems enable companies to transform network and IT operations by using AI-driven automation to detect anomalies, determine resolution, and implement the required changes within a continuous highly automated framework. Closed-loop automation helps solve many problems before they even become issues.Read more about Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps.One common use case for closed-loop automation is traffic flow optimization. By implementing a closed-loop automation system, teams can automatically correct issues like network anomalies within the provisioned network infrastructure. At the heart of a closed-loop automation system for the traffic flow optimization use case are the components of IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps, which is at the heart of IBMs AIOps platform.\\nWhat is closed-loop automation?\\nA simple closed-loop implementation detects issues that could happen in the future. The appropriate data is analyzed by various predictive models, which then make a recommendation on the change to be made to the orchestration layer, which implements the change.\\nIn complex cases, closed-loop automation combines the predictive insights information with additional AI systems to determine a resolution. The AI system is trained to resolve these issues and is integrated with a robotics automation system  to automate the resolution process. If the AI system determines it has a high confidence that the suggested resolution is correct, it will invoke the orchestration engine to implement the solution automatically. If not, a trouble ticket is generated, and an engineer works to resolve the issue.\\nThe following image provides an overview of a closed-loop automation system that addresses issues of varying complexity.Closed-loop automation enables these key capabilities:Anomaly detection. Anomaly detection uses large, real-time, time-series data to analyze networks applications, database metrics, operating systems, and so on. This gives anomaly detection the capability to identify patterns and anomalies, and raise awareness toward predictive actions.\\nIntelligent alerts. In a general operations environment, multiple connected components can raise alerts all related to the same failure event. These add to the overall load and volume of operations teams. However, 20 percent of overall alert volume is false-positive. Closed-loop automation uses machine learning models to create the patterns for the series of alerts so that those can be bound to causes and known actions, and then be corrected accordingly.\\nPredictive planning. Organizations can use machine learning algorithms to predict how application and network behaviors are dependent on seasonality and other factors to ensure that appropriate corrective actions are taken, thereby permitting systems to perform optimally.\\nRoot-cause analysis. Closed-loop automation leverages data to intelligently identify all anomalies in the service path and use AI to map it to find the most likely cause for a particular incident. It makes use of various AI algorithms to ensure the accuracy of root-cause identifications and implements the required remediation steps.IT Ops teams apply AI and ', 'url': 'https://developer.ibm.com/middleware/v1/contents /articles/an-introduction-to-closed-loop-automation\\n'}, 'score': 19.22018051147461}, {'document': {'rank': 0, 'document_id': ' ', 'text': 'It used to be that the developer and operations roles were fully separated. The developer received the business requirements, they came up with a design and implemented it. A dedicated QA team wrote tests, and validated that the new application, capability, or change worked as expected, and then the code or application was handed over to the operations team to run it. In most organizations, these roles have now merged into a set of development practices that are commonly referred to as DevOps.\\nTo learn more about what is SRE, read this Red Hat article.\\nAt the same time, DevOps practices brought an expanded role for the operations teams, typically referred to now as a Site Reliability Engineering, or SRE. Red Hat defines the DevOps practice of SRE like this SRE takes the tasks that have historically been done by operations teams, often manually, and instead gives them to engineers or ops teams who use software and automation to solve problems and manage production systems.\\nNow, the SRE role, can either be a dedicated engineering position, or frequently is one that the developers take on, either full or part time. The goal of SRE is to create a natural improvement cycle, which one gets by linking the application development and operations portions. The applications can be created such that they are easier to manage and observe, while the insights from monitoring the application, can in turn identify inefficiencies, defects, and potential improvements.\\nIn this article, we will focus on how Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps can help an SRE  improve and automate their applications. To reiterate, though, while we will use the term SRE throughout this article, SRE also applies to IT Operations engineers and application developers who are supporting their products.\\nAn SRE focuses on reacting to problems encountered by the application, but also on crafting ways to improve the time to repair the application , or even better on avoiding these problems in the first place.\\nSo, what is important to an SRE? When a problem occurs, they need to have a holistic view of what is happening to their application. This means they should have a real-time view of the state of all their components, understand what is relevant in their logs or metrics, and know whether any of their monitors, such as synthetic consumption monitors show any problems. However, they do not want to be inundated with lots of different alerts going off, but rather they want to know where to focus their time and attention. After a problem has been confirmed, they would like guidance on possible solutions, and automation to execute them. Ideally though, this would be available to them before a problem becomes an outage.\\nHistorically, two factors stood in the way here: the sheer volume of data and the fact that a lot of that data was in an unstructured format. As long as there have been applications, there have been simple monitoring tools. For example, an operator would set an alert on the memory consumption of an application, and when it breached a given amount, an alert would go off. Apart from being a blunt instrument , this approach might have been practical when the operator was monitoring a handful of monolithic applications.\\nNow that SREs are monitoring thousands of microservices, this approach is no longer practical. Secondly, with the advent of AI, we now have a way to unlock all the value of unstructured  data. For example, many problems show early warnings in your logs, long before an application starts showing problems , but the problems dont have an impact yet and thus they wont fail the main application flow.\\nAs such, some of the features that an AIOps solution like Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps that support SREs are:No code changes are required. Your applications and your site reliability processes already output a lot of helpful information. Its time to take advantage of that data.\\nBring all your disparate data sources together for a holistic view across all parts of your e', 'url': 'https://developer.ibm.com/middleware/v1/contents /articles/improving-and-automating-your-ops-with-cp4waiops\\n'}, 'score': 17.130687713623047}, {'document': {'rank': 3, 'document_id': ' ', 'text': \"In this blog, I will answer the following general questions about AIOps:What is AIOps?\\nWhat does a company need to utilize AIOps?\\nHow do I train AI?\\nWhat is no-code AI?\\nWhy is this important?What is AIOps?\\nGartners definition of AIOps: AIOps combines big data and machine learning to automate IT operations  processes, including event correlation, anomaly detection, and causality determination.\\nITOps teams are beginning to explore how automation can improve business outcomes through scalable artificial intelligence .

By applying AI, what does the company intend to do to improve outcomes? Next, companies will need to consider if the organization has historical and real-time data organized in a way that can begin to train models, and if so, is it understandable.\\nHow do I train AI?\\nIf a company wants to use AIOps they need to establish a baseline performance, which requires that they have an understanding of their historical data by measuring the performance of their steady state using real-time data. When something bad happens to a system, like an application outage, the company can more efficiently pinpoint the issue by using insights gathered from historical and real-time data. This insightful information can help find ways to triage events or outages as efficiently as possible.\\nWhat is no-code AI?\\nCompanies don't always have data scientists, data engineers, or data centric teams to help. What if we could train AI without the assistance of data scientists, data engineers, and data centric teams?\\nNo-code AI simply means using no-code in automation training. A company can use its history and what it is doing today as a baseline to improve its tomorrow without developing code to train the AI.\\nWhy is this important?\\nAs an IT admin juggling multiple sources of data and resolving incidents manually, you need tools to help you resolve incidents faster.\\nTime is money. Battling aggressive timelines, ITOps teams need to identify solutions quickly and have those solutions work correctly when theyre set in motion. Lets unpack how this is achieved with Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps.\\nSo, what is the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps?\\nCloud Pak for Watson AIOps provides an application-centric data and intelligence platform powering automation for application, incident, cost, and security  risk management with trusted and explainable AI.\\nFigure 1: Bringing DevSecOps together with AI and automationThe goal of using AIOps is to focus on business outcomes. To do this, a company must leverage its data without creating gates of entry by requiring a dedicated data scientist, data engineer, or a data-centric team to get up and running. Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps provides a comprehensive understanding of business applications baked in to help provide insights and intelligence derived from not just operational data such as logs or events but enhanced organizational insights as well.\\nLearn more about Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps can evolve your ITOps organization.

A TensorFlow application uses a structure known as a data flow graph. By default in TensorFlow version 1.0, every graph had to be run within a TensorFlow session, which only allowed for the entire graph to be run all at once, and made it hard to debug the computation graph. The only way to get around this default and be able to debug the code was to use Eager Execution.\\nEager Execution is a flexible machine learning platform for research and experimentation that provides:An intuitive interface so that the code can be structured naturally and use Python data structures.

It's all ball bearings nowadays.\" - Fletch, 1985 movie\\nSadly, it is not all about ball bearings nowadays. It's all about containers. If you heard about containers, but are not sure what they are, you've come to the right place. This blog post addresses the following questions:Why should I care about containers?\\nWhat are containers?\\nAre containers the same as microservices?\\nWhat is an example of a microservices application?\\nWhat is a Docker container?\\nWhat are container orchestration and Kubernetes?\\nWhat is the difference between containers and virtual machine images?\\nHow can I get started with containers?\\nHow can IBM Cloud Paks help?\\nWhere can I run my containers?\\nWhat is Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud?Why should I care about containers?\\nAcross organizations, there is a spectrum of container adoption. Many people are just learning about containers. Some companies are further along in their journey. If you're at all considering containerization, it's time to join the fun where you can see real business results:Faster time to market: New applications and services are what keep your competitive edge. Organizations are able to speed up delivery of new services with development and operational agility.\\nDeployment velocity: Move quicker from development to deployment. Containerization breaks down barriers for DevOps teams to accelerate deployment times and frequency.\\nIT infrastructure reduction: Reduce your costs by increasing your application workload density, getting better utilization of your server compute density, and reducing software licensing costs.\\nIT operational efficiency: Gain more operational efficiency by streamlining and automating the management of diverse applications and infrastructure into a single operating model.\\nGain freedom of choice: Package, ship, and run applications on any public or private cloud.Next steps: Learn what the true benefits of moving to containers are.What are containers?\\nThe best analogy for understanding containers is a shipping container. That's why the majority of all container articles and blog posts show a photo of a shipping container. We're sure you've seen the transport of those big steel shipping containers.  The shipping industry standardized on a consistent size container. Now, the same container can move from a ship to a train to a truck without unloading the cargo. The container contents do not matter.\\nJust like a shipping container, a software container is a standardized package of software. Everything needed for the software to run is inside the container. The software code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings are all inside a single container.\\nAre containers the same thing as microservices?\\nOnce you start diving into containers, it's impossible to avoid reading about microservices.  Microservices is an architectural style. A microservices architecture structures an application by using as a collection of loosely coupled services, which deliver specific business capabilities. Containers help make it happen.\\nWhat is an example of a microservices application?\\nMore than ten years ago, Netflix was one of the first companies to begin using containers extensively. They rewrote the applications that ran their entire video service by using a microservices architecture. In 2017, Netflix estimated that it employed around 700 microservices to control each of the many functions that make up its service. Let's look at a few :Video selection: A microservice, in a container, provides your phone, tablet, computer, or TV with the video file to play and at a video quality based on your internet speed.\\nViewing history: One microservice remembers what shows you watch.\\nProgram recommendations: A microservice takes a look at your viewing history and uses analytics to recommend movies.\\nMain menu: One microservice provides the names and images of these movies shown on your main menu.\\nBilling: Another microser</td>\n",

And the third post will focus on lessons learned from installing, maintaining, and verifying the connectivity of the two platforms. Lets get started!\\nIn this post we will be outlining the main integration points between Cloudera Data Platform and IBM Cloud Pak for Data, and explaining how the two distinct data and AI platforms can communicate with each other. Integrating two platforms is made easy with capabilities available out of the box for both IBM Cloud Pak for Data and Cloudera Data Platform. Establishing a connection between the two is just a few clicks away.Architecture diagram showing Cloudera Data Plaform for Cloud Pak for Data\\nIn our view, there are three key points to integrating Cloudera Data Platform and IBM Cloud Pak for Data; all other services piggyback on one of these:Apache Knox Gateway \\nExecution Engine for Apache Hadoop \\nDb2 Big SQL Read on for more information about how each integration point works. For a demonstration on how to use data from Hive and Db2 check out the video below where we join the data using Data Virtualization and then display it with IBM Cognos Analytics check out the video below.Apache Knox Gateway\\nTo truly be secure, a Hadoop cluster needs Kerberos. However, Kerberos requires a client-side library and complex client-side configuration. This is where the Apache Knox Gateway  comes in. By encapsulating Kerberos, Knox eliminates the need for client software or client configuration and, thus, simplifies the access model. Knox integrates with identity management and SSO systems, such as Active Directory and LDAP, to allow identities from these systems to be used for access to Cloudera clusters.Knox dashboard showing the list of supported services\\nCloudera services such as Impala, Hive, and HDFS can be configured with Knox, allowing JDBC connections to easily be created in IBM Cloud Pak for Data.Creating a JDBC connection to Impala via KnoxList of connections on IBM Cloud Pak for Data\\nExecution Engine for Apache Hadoop\\nThe Execution Engine for Apache Hadoop service is installed on both IBM Cloud Pak for Data and on the worker nodes of a Cloudera Data Platform deployment.

Closed-loop automation helps solve many problems before they even become issues.Read more about Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps.One common use case for closed-loop automation is traffic flow optimization. By implementing a closed-loop automation system, teams can automatically correct issues like network anomalies within the provisioned network infrastructure. At the heart of a closed-loop automation system for the traffic flow optimization use case are the components of IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps, which is at the heart of IBMs AIOps platform.\\nWhat is closed-loop automation?\\nA simple closed-loop implementation detects issues that could happen in the future. The appropriate data is analyzed by various predictive models, which then make a recommendation on the change to be made to the orchestration layer, which implements the change.\\nIn complex cases, closed-loop automation combines the predictive insights information with additional AI systems to determine a resolution. The AI system is trained to resolve these issues and is integrated with a robotics automation system  to automate the resolution process. If the AI system determines it has a high confidence that the suggested resolution is correct, it will invoke the orchestration engine to implement the solution automatically. If not, a trouble ticket is generated, and an engineer works to resolve the issue.\\nThe following image provides an overview of a closed-loop automation system that addresses issues of varying complexity.Closed-loop automation enables these key capabilities:Anomaly detection. Anomaly detection uses large, real-time, time-series data to analyze networks applications, database metrics, operating systems, and so on. This gives anomaly detection the capability to identify patterns and anomalies, and raise awareness toward predictive actions.\\nIntelligent alerts. In a general operations environment, multiple connected components can raise alerts all related to the same failure event. These add to the overall load and volume of operations teams. However, 20 percent of overall alert volume is false-positive. Closed-loop automation uses machine learning models to create the patterns for the series of alerts so that those can be bound to causes and known actions, and then be corrected accordingly.\\nPredictive planning. Organizations can use machine learning algorithms to predict how application and network behaviors are dependent on seasonality and other factors to ensure that appropriate corrective actions are taken, thereby permitting systems to perform optimally.\\nRoot-cause analysis. Closed-loop automation leverages data to intelligently identify all anomalies in the service path and use AI to map it to find the most likely cause for a particular incident. It makes use of various AI algorithms to ensure the accuracy of root-cause identifications and implements the required remediation steps.IT Ops teams apply AI and</td>\n",

       "      <td>It used to be that the developer and operations roles were fully separated. The developer received the business requirements, they came up with a design and implemented it. A dedicated QA team wrote tests, and validated that the new application, capability, or change worked as expected, and then the code or application was handed over to the operations team to run it. In most organizations, these roles have now merged into a set of development practices that are commonly referred to as DevOps.\\nTo learn more about what is SRE, read this Red Hat article.\\nAt the same time, DevOps practices brought an expanded role for the operations teams, typically referred to now as a Site Reliability Engineering, or SRE. Red Hat defines the DevOps practice of SRE like this SRE takes the tasks that have historically been done by operations teams, often manually, and instead gives them to engineers or ops teams who use software and automation to solve problems and manage production systems.\\nNow, the SRE role, can either be a dedicated engineering position, or frequently is one that the developers take on, either full or part time. The goal of SRE is to create a natural improvement cycle, which one gets by linking the application development and operations portions. The applications can be created such that they are easier to manage and observe, while the insights from monitoring the application, can in turn identify inefficiencies, defects, and potential improvements.\\nIn this article, we will focus on how Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps can help an SRE  improve and automate their applications. To reiterate, though, while we will use the term SRE throughout this article, SRE also applies to IT Operations engineers and application developers who are supporting their products.\\nAn SRE focuses on reacting to problems encountered by the application, but also on crafting ways to improve the time to repair the application , or even better on avoiding these problems in the first place.\\nSo, what is important to an SRE? When a problem occurs, they need to have a holistic view of what is happening to their application. This means they should have a real-time view of the state of all their components, understand what is relevant in their logs or metrics, and know whether any of their monitors, such as synthetic consumption monitors show any problems. However, they do not want to be inundated with lots of different alerts going off, but rather they want to know where to focus their time and attention. After a problem has been confirmed, they would like guidance on possible solutions, and automation to execute them. Ideally though, this would be available to them before a problem becomes an outage.\\nHistorically, two factors stood in the way here: the sheer volume of data and the fact that a lot of that data was in an unstructured format. As long as there have been applications, there have been simple monitoring tools. For example, an operator would set an alert on the memory consumption of an application, and when it breached a given amount, an alert would go off. Apart from being a blunt instrument , this approach might have been practical when the operator was monitoring a handful of monolithic applications.\\nNow that SREs are monitoring thousands of microservices, this approach is no longer practical. Secondly, with the advent of AI, we now have a way to unlock all the value of unstructured  data. For example, many problems show early warnings in your logs, long before an application starts showing problems , but the problems dont have an impact yet and thus they wont fail the main application flow.\\nAs such, some of the features that an AIOps solution like Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps that support SREs are:No code changes are required. Your applications and your site reliability processes already output a lot of helpful information. Its time to take advantage of that data.\\nBring all your disparate data sources together for a holistic view across all parts of your e</td>\n",

       "      <td>In this blog, I will answer the following general questions about AIOps:What is AIOps?\\nWhat does a company need to utilize AIOps?\\nHow do I train AI?\\nWhat is no-code AI?\\nWhy is this important?What is AIOps?\\nGartners definition of AIOps: AIOps combines big data and machine learning to automate IT operations  processes, including event correlation, anomaly detection, and causality determination.\\nITOps teams are beginning to explore how automation can improve business outcomes through scalable artificial intelligence . Gartner found that 10 times more business leaders will rely on AIOps platforms for automated insights in the next three years. Without it, IT organizations can experience a lack of observability, become overwhelmed from manually managing data, and end up focusing on infrastructure rather than an application-centric approach. The ITOps teams of tomorrow will experience full visualization and observability of their IT environments with insights derived from various tools that focus on critical applications to support business performance.\\nWhat does a company need to be able to use AIOps?\\nTo start, ITOps organizations can determine what the company needs in business performance. By applying AI, what does the company intend to do to improve outcomes? Next, companies will need to consider if the organization has historical and real-time data organized in a way that can begin to train models, and if so, is it understandable.\\nHow do I train AI?\\nIf a company wants to use AIOps they need to establish a baseline performance, which requires that they have an understanding of their historical data by measuring the performance of their steady state using real-time data. When something bad happens to a system, like an application outage, the company can more efficiently pinpoint the issue by using insights gathered from historical and real-time data. This insightful information can help find ways to triage events or outages as efficiently as possible.\\nWhat is no-code AI?\\nCompanies don't always have data scientists, data engineers, or data centric teams to help. What if we could train AI without the assistance of data scientists, data engineers, and data centric teams?\\nNo-code AI simply means using no-code in automation training. A company can use its history and what it is doing today as a baseline to improve its tomorrow without developing code to train the AI.\\nWhy is this important?\\nAs an IT admin juggling multiple sources of data and resolving incidents manually, you need tools to help you resolve incidents faster.\\nTime is money. Battling aggressive timelines, ITOps teams need to identify solutions quickly and have those solutions work correctly when theyre set in motion. Lets unpack how this is achieved with Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps.\\nSo, what is the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps?\\nCloud Pak for Watson AIOps provides an application-centric data and intelligence platform powering automation for application, incident, cost, and security  risk management with trusted and explainable AI.\\nFigure 1: Bringing DevSecOps together with AI and automationThe goal of using AIOps is to focus on business outcomes. To do this, a company must leverage its data without creating gates of entry by requiring a dedicated data scientist, data engineer, or a data-centric team to get up and running. Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps provides a comprehensive understanding of business applications baked in to help provide insights and intelligence derived from not just operational data such as logs or events but enhanced organizational insights as well.\\nLearn more about Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps can evolve your ITOps organization.

       "      <td>TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source machine learning platform that makes it easier to build and deploy machine learning models. A TensorFlow application uses a structure known as a data flow graph. By default in TensorFlow version 1.0, every graph had to be run within a TensorFlow session, which only allowed for the entire graph to be run all at once, and made it hard to debug the computation graph. The only way to get around this default and be able to debug the code was to use Eager Execution.\\nEager Execution is a flexible machine learning platform for research and experimentation that provides:An intuitive interface so that the code can be structured naturally and use Python data structures. Small models and small data can be quickly iterated.\\nEasier debugging by providing the ability to call operations directly to inspect code line by line and test changes.\\nA natural control flow using a Python control flow instead of a graph control flow, which simplifies the specification of dynamic models.With TensorFlow 2.x, Eager Execution is enabled by default, and allows TensorFlow code to be run and evaluated line by line.\\nLearning objectives\\nThis tutorial looks at the impact of Eager Execution and the benefits of having it enabled by default in TensorFlow 2.x. You'll use a Jupyter Notebook to observe the behavior of TensorFlow when Eager Execution is both disabled and enabled.

      "INPUT PROMPT:  Answer the question based only on the context below. Context: Awww, come on guys, it's so simple. Maybe you need a refresher course. ... It's all ball bearings nowadays.\" - Fletch, 1985 movie Sadly, it is not all about ball bearings nowadays. It's all about containers. If you heard about containers, but are not sure what they are, you've come to the right place. This blog post addresses the following questions:Why should I care about containers? What are containers? Are containers the same as microservices? What is an example of a microservices application? What is a Docker container? What are container orchestration and Kubernetes? What is the difference between containers and virtual machine images? How can I get started with containers? How can IBM Cloud Paks help? Where can I run my containers? What is Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud?Why should I care about containers? Across organizations, there is a spectrum of container adoption. Many people are just learning about containers. Some companies are further along in their journey. If you're at all considering containerization, it's time to join the fun where you can see real business results:Faster time to market: New applications and services are what keep your competitive edge. Organizations are able to speed up delivery of new services with development and operational agility. Deployment velocity: Move quicker from development to deployment. Containerization breaks down barriers for DevOps teams to accelerate deployment times and frequency. IT infrastructure reduction: Reduce your costs by increasing your application workload density, getting better utilization of your server compute density, and reducing software licensing costs. IT operational efficiency: Gain more operational efficiency by streamlining and automating the management of diverse applications and infrastructure into a single operating model. Gain freedom of choice: Package, ship, and run applications on any public or private cloud.Next steps: Learn what the true benefits of moving to containers are.What are containers? The best analogy for understanding containers is a shipping container. That's why the majority of all container articles and blog posts show a photo of a shipping container. We're sure you've seen the transport of those big steel shipping containers. The shipping industry standardized on a consistent size container. Now, the same container can move from a ship to a train to a truck without unloading the cargo. The container contents do not matter. Just like a shipping container, a software container is a standardized package of software. Everything needed for the software to run is inside the container. The software code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings are all inside a single container. Are containers the same thing as microservices? Once you start diving into containers, it's impossible to avoid reading about microservices. Microservices is an architectural style. A microservices architecture structures an application by using as a collection of loosely coupled services, which deliver specific business capabilities. Containers help make it happen. What is an example of a microservices application? More than ten years ago, Netflix was one of the first companies to begin using containers extensively. They rewrote the applications that ran their entire video service by using a microservices architecture. In 2017, Netflix estimated that it employed around 700 microservices to control each of the many functions that make up its service. Let's look at a few :Video selection: A microservice, in a container, provides your phone, tablet, computer, or TV with the video file to play and at a video quality based on your internet speed. Viewing history: One microservice remembers what shows you watch. Program recommendations: A microservice takes a look at your viewing history and uses analytics to recommend movies. Main menu: One microservice provides the names and images of these movies shown on your main menu. Billing: Another microser Question: what is ibm cloud pak for data\n",
