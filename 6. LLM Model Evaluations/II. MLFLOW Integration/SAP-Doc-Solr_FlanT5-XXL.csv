When do I use dynamic rounding?,"n Maintain Rounding Profile configuration step, you define how dynamic rounding takes place, by defining a dynamic rounding profile, a rounding rule, and a unit of measure group. Rounding profiles and unit of measure groups are then assigned to the products / purchasing info record.

Dynamic Rounding Profile.

A dynamic rounding profile consists of a rounding rule and a rounding method.

Rounding method.

The rounding method controls how rounding is performed. The rounding methods that are possible are predefined in the system. The following are examples of possible rounding methods:

Rounding to a multiple of the order/sales unit without a change in the unit of measure.

Rounding to a multiple of the order/sales unit with a possible change to the unit of measure (for example, to larger units, such as pallets).

Rounding rule

The rounding rule consists of units of measure and percentage threshold values. You can define your own rounding rules in Maintain Rounding Profile configuration step. You do this by assigning a threshold value at which the system rounds up or down, to each unit of measure. The rules for conversion between the different units of measure must be defined in the relevant product master.

Unit of measure group

The unit of measure group specifies which units of measure are allowed for the supplier or the recipient of the goods. The units of measure to be used in rounding are derived from the rounding rule and the units of measure to be used for the product. If you wish to round to a specific unit of measure, the system performs the following checks based on the settings in the rounding profile:

Is the unit of measure contained in the unit of measure group for the product from the supplier?

Is the unit of measure contained in the unit of measure group for the product from the distribution chain?",Dynamic rounding rounds to multiples of a unit of measure and are suited for rounding to complete logistical units of measure such as whole pallets.,When I am converting a decimal number to a fraction.,0.0625,0.5866801386529749,1.0618063059647207e-231,0.2583443,0.16000000000000003,0.11428571428571428,31,23.975095546559153
When do I use static rounding? ,"A static rounding profile comprises threshold and rounding values, whereby every threshold value is assigned a rounding value. In rounding off, the system starts with the highest level in the rounding profile. It processes all the levels below that, carrying out the calculation until the procedure is stopped or until the lowest level is reached. The lowest level is processed differently, as the rounding logic is different here than in the other levels.

The steps in the procedure are as follows:

As long as the lowest level has not been reached:

It divides the quantity required into whole numbers by the rounding value of the current level.

It then checks whether the remainder is equal to or greater than the threshold value of the current level.

If yes:

It rounds up the quantity required to the next multiple of the rounding value of the current level and stops there.

If no:

It repeats the procedure with the next lower level.

If the lowest level has been reached:

It checks whether the quantity required is equal to or greater than the threshold value of the lowest level.

If yes:

It rounds up the quantity required to the next multiple of the rounding value of the first level and stops there.

If no:

It does not change the quantity required and stops there.","Static rounding round up to a multiple of a unit of measure without changing the unit of measure.
