Himadri,"Why do we need quantum computers?
","For some problems, supercomputers aren’t that super.

When scientists and engineers encounter difficult problems, they turn to supercomputers. These are very large classical computers, often with thousands of classical CPU and GPU cores. However, even supercomputers struggle to solve certain kinds of problems.

If a supercomputer gets stumped, that's probably because the big classical machine was asked to solve a problem with a high degree of complexity. When classical computers fail, it's often due to complexity

Complex problems are problems with lots of variables interacting in complicated ways. Modeling the behavior of individual atoms in a molecule is a complex problem, because of all the different electrons interacting with one another. Sorting out the ideal routes for a few hundred tankers in a global shipping network is complex too.","The quantum computer has dramatically increased processing capabilities over classical computers based on the qubit , or quantum bit that is the basic unit of quantum information , that can be in a state of both 1 and 0 at the same time .",3.232866437160679e-155,0.022172949,0.052980132,0.2430763972255569,0.17341040462427745,0.29688329,24,95.30499118662769,-1.0256530046463013,0.1038961038961039,0.5371989972061582
