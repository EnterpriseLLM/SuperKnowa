Each action has a beginning and an end, making up a conversation between the assistant and a customer. Learn how to begin an action, where it understands and recognizes a goal based on the words a customer uses to ask a question or make a request. \\n\\n Beginning an action \\n\\n {: #understand-questions-start} \\n\\n Each assistant can include as many actions as you need to have conversations with your users. You design each individual action to recognize a specific question or request, and when it does, the action starts. \\n\\n When you create a new action, your first task is to enter one phrase that a customer types or says to start the conversation about a specific topic. This phrase determines the problem that your customer has or the question your user asks. \\n\\n To get going, you need to enter only one phrase, for example:  What are your store hours? . \\n\\n After you enter the phrase, it is stored in  Customer starts with , at the start of the action. \\n\\n  Customer starts with images/customer-starts-with.png   \\n\\n Testing your phrase \\n\\n {: #understand-questions-testing} \\n\\n Before even doing anything else with your action, you can already start checking that your assistant recognizes the starting phrase. \\n\\n \\t Click the  Preview  button. \\n\\t Enter your first phrase, for example:  What are your store hours? . \\n\\t \\n If you see  There are no additional steps for this action , that means the action recognizes the phrase. (And it\\'s because you haven\\'t added anything else to your action.) \\n\\n  Preview images/new-action-preview.png   \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n If the assistant doesn\\'t understand the phrase, you\\'ll see the built-in action  No action matches .

You can build the rest of your action with steps before adding more example phrases. Then, return to  Customer starts with  and add 10 or more variations of the same question or request, using words that your customers commonly use. For example: \\n\\n \\t  Are you open on the weekend?  \\n\\t  How late are you open today?  \\n\\t  Get store hours  \\n\\t  What time do you open?  \\n\\t  Are you open now?  \\n \\n\\n Each phrase can be up to 1,024 characters in length. \\n\\n By adding these phrases, your assistant learns what is the right action for what a customer wants. The additional examples build the training data that the machine learning engine of Watson Assistant uses to create a natural language processing model. The model is customized to understand your uniquely defined actions. \\n\\n Uploading phrases \\n\\n {: #understand-questions-uploading-examples} \\n\\n If you have many example phrases, you can upload them from a comma-separated value (CSV) file than to define them one by one. If you are migrating intent information from the classic {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} experience to example phrases in the new {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} experience, see  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-migrate-intents-entities Migrating intents and entities . \\n\\n \\t \\n Collect the phrases into a CSV file. Save the CSV file with UTF-8 encoding and no byte order mark (BOM). \\n\\n \\t \\n If you are creating a new CSV file to upload phrases, the format for each line in the file is as follows:\\n     text\\n    <phrase> \\n    Where  <phrase>  is the text of a user example phrase. If youâ€™re using a spreadsheet to create a CSV file, put all your phrases into column 1, as shown in the following example: \\n\\n  Example spreadsheet to upload phrases images/uploading-phrases-spreadsheet.png   \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n If you  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-migrate-intents-entities#migrate-intents-download downloaded intents from the classic experience , the format for each line in the file is as follows:\\n     text\\n    <phrase>,<intent> \\n    Where  <phrase>  is the text of a user example phrase, and  <intent>  is the name of the intent. For example:\\n     text\\n    Tell me the current weather conditions.,weather_conditions\\n    Is it raining?,weather_conditions\\n    What\\'s the temperature?,weather_conditions  \\n\\n Only one intent can be uploaded per action, so the  <intent>  information listed in the second column of the CSV file must be the same.\\n{: important} \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n Go to  Customer starts with  at the start of the action. \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n Click the  Upload  icon  Upload icon images/upload-icon.png  . \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n Select a file from your computer. \\n\\n The file is validated and uploaded, and the system trains itself on the new data. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n Downloading phrases \\n\\n {: #understand-questions-downloading-examples} \\n\\n You can download your example phrases to a CSV file, so you can then upload and reuse them in another {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} application. \\n\\n \\t \\n Go to  Customer starts with  at the start of the action. \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n Click the  Download  icon  Download icon images/download-icon.png  . \\n\\n Your example phrases are downloaded to a CSV file. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n Asking clarifying questions \\n\\n {: #understand-questions-ask-clarifying-question} \\n\\n When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer\\'s request, it can automatically ask for clarification. Instead of guessing which action to take, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer, and asks the customer to pick the right one. \\n\\n  Shows a sample conversation between a user and the assistant, where the assistant asks for clarification from the user. images/disambig-demo.png   \\n\\n Any  Created by you  action that might match the customer\\'s input can be included in the choices that are listed by a clarifying question. The  Set by assistant  actions are never included. \\n\\n In the assistant output, the possible actions are listed by name. The default name for an action is the text of the first example message that you add to it (such as  I want to open an account ), but you can change this name to something more descriptive. \\n\\n The order in which the actions are listed might change. In fact, the actions themselves that are included in the list might change. This behavior is intended. As part of development that is in progress to help the assistant learn automatically from user choices, the actions that are included and their order in the list is randomized on purpose. Randomizing the order helps to prevent bias that can be introduced by a percentage of people who always pick the first option without carefully reviewing all of their choices beforehand. \\n\\n Customizing clarification \\n\\n {: #understand-questions-disambiguation-config} \\n\\n To customize clarification, you can:\\n- Choose a default  action response mode , which modifies the assistant\\'s behavior when asking questions. For more information, see  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-action-response-modes Action response modes .\\n- Change settings like the wording your assistant uses to introduce the clarification list. \\n\\n To change settings, complete the following steps: \\n\\n \\t \\n From the  Actions  page of the assistant, click  Global settings   Gear icon ../../icons/settings.svg  . \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n On the  Action response modes  tab, you can make the following changes in the  Ask clarifying question  section: \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n | Field | Default text | Description |\\n   |---|---|---|\\n   |  Assistant says  |  Did you mean:  | The text that is displayed before the list of clarification choices. You can change it to something else, such as  What do you want to do?  or  Pick what to do next . |\\n   |  Connection to support  |  Connect to support  | The assistant can include a choice to connect to other support in the list of clarifying questions. If the customer picks this choice, the assistant uses your  Fallback  action. You can change it to something else, such as  Talk to a live agent  or  Search for the answer . |\\n   |  No action matches  |  None of the above  | The choice that customers can click when none of the other choices are right. If the customer picks this choice, the assistant uses your  No action matches  action. You can change it to something else, such as  I need something else  or  These aren\\'t what I want . Or, you can remove the text to omit offering this choice.\\n   |  One action matches  |  Something else  | If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer need, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This choice accompanies the single action in case the customer needs something else. You can change it to something else, such as  I need something else  or  This isn\\'t what I want . |\\n   {: caption=\"Ask clarifying question settings\" caption-side=\"top\"} \\n\\n \\t \\n Click  Save , and then click  Close . \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n Publish a new version of your assistant to the live environment to apply the customizations. For more information, see  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-publish Publishing your content . \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n Disabling clarifying questions \\n\\n {: #understand-questions-disambiguation-disable} \\n\\n You can disable clarifying questions for all actions. \\n\\n To disable clarification for all actions: \\n\\n \\t From the  Actions  page of the assistant, click  Global settings   Gear icon ../../icons/settings.svg  . \\n\\t On the  Action response modes  tab, in the  Customize modes  section, ensure that the Response modes switch is set to  Off . \\n\\t In the  Ask clarifying question  section, set the  Enable disambiguation  switch to  Off . \\n\\t Click  Save , and then click  Close . \\n\\t Publish a new version of your assistant to the live environment to disable clarification. For more information, see  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-publish Publishing your content . \\n \\n\\n Excluding an action from clarifying questions \\n\\n {: #understand-questions-exclude-from-clarifying} \\n\\n You can also prevent a single action from being used in a clarifying question. The effect of this choice depends on the confidence score for the action that you exclude. \\n\\n If the action has the highest confidence score for a customer\\'s question, no clarifying question is asked, and the action is triggered. \\n\\n If the action doesn\\'t have the highest confidence score, the action is excluded from the list of choices in the clarifying question. \\n\\n For more information about confidence scores, see  rect #understand-questions-confidence-scoring Confidence scoring . \\n\\n To exclude an action from clarification: \\n\\n \\t \\n From the action editor, click the  Action settings  icon  Gear icon ../../icons/settings.svg  . \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n In Action Settings, toggle the  Ask clarifying question  switch to  Off . \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n Coordinating how multiple actions start \\n\\n {: #understand-questions-multiple-actions} \\n\\n As you work on your assistant, it\\'s a good idea to coordinate customer phrase examples across multiple actions. It\\'s important to distinguish how each action is triggered. When a user enters a question or request, the phrase is evaluated across all the  Customer starts with  examples in every action. If two actions have similar phrase examples, then the wrong action might get triggered by your user\\'s question. \\n\\n Confidence scoring \\n\\n {: #understand-questions-confidence-scoring} \\n\\n Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant determines a confidence score for each phrase. The score is absolute, meaning that a confidence score is assigned based on a predetermined scale, and not relative to other customer phrases. This approach adds flexibility in case multiple questions or requests are detected in a single user input. It also means that the system might not trigger an action at all, if a phrase has a low confidence score. As confidence scores change, your action examples might need restructuring. \\n\\n To learn more about review and testing confidence scores, see  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-review#review-debug-confidence Action confidence score  in  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-review Reviewing and debugging your work . \\n  ']\n",

The first group connects customers with an agent, when itâ€™s important for a customer to speak with a live agent rather than activate any further actions. The second group shows customers a customizable warning message, used to discourage customers from interacting with your assistant in unacceptable ways, such as using profanity. This action is included with all new assistants created as of this date. This is a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes. For more information, see  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-trigger-phrases Detecting trigger words . \\n\\n Changes to unrecognized requests algorithm\\n:   In  Analyze , the  Recognition  page lets you view groups of similar unrecognized requests. You can use the requests as example phrases in new or existing actions to address questions and issues that aren\\'t being answered by your assistant.

In real life, however, conversations almost never follow such a simple flow. In the middle of a conversation, customers might get distracted, ask questions about related issues, misunderstand something, or just change their minds about what they want to do. The **Change conversation topic** feature enables your assistant to handle these digressions, dynamically responding to the user by changing the conversation topic as needed. For more information, see [Changing the topic of the conversation](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-actions#actions-change-topic){: external}.\\n\\n- **Fallback action**: The built-in action, *Fallback*, provides a way to automatically connect customers to a human agent if they need more help. This action helps you to handle errors in the conversation, and is triggered by these conditions:\\n    - Step validation failed: The customer repeatedly gave answers that were not valid for the expected customer response type.\\n    - Agent requested: The customer directly asked to be connected to a human agent.\\n    - No action matches: The customer repeatedly made requests or asked questions that the assistant did not understand.\\n\\n    For more information, see [Set by assistant actions](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-actions#actions-builtin){: external}.\\n  \\n\\n Dialog skill \"Try it out\" improvements\\n:   For dialog skills, the  Try it out  pane now uses the  rect https://reactjs.org/ React {: external} UI framework similar to the rest of the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} user interface.

After you update your custom applications to use the new credential, you can delete the old one.\\n\\n- For a web chat integration, you might need to take action depending on when and how you created your integration.\\n\\n    - If you tied your deployment to a specific web chat version by using the `clientVersion` parameter and specified a version earlier than version 3.3.0, update the parameter value to use version 3.3.0 or later. Web chat integrations that use the latest or 3.3.0 and later versions will not be impacted by the endpoint deprecation.\\n\\n    - If you created your web chat integration before May 2020, check the code snippet that you embedded in your web page to see if it refers to `watsonplatform.net`. If so, you must edit the code snippet to use the new URL syntax. For example, change the following URL:\\n\\n        ```html\\n         <script src=\"https://assistant-web.watsonplatform.net/loadWatsonAssistantChat.js\"></script>\\n        ```\\n\\n        The correct syntax to use for the source service URL looks like this:\\n\\n        ```code\\n        src=\"https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud/loadWatsonAssistantChat.js\"\\n        ```\\n\\n- If your web chat integration connects to a Salesforce service desk, then you must edit the API call that is included in the code snippet that you added to the Visualforce Page that you created in Salesforce. From Salesforce, search for *Visualforce Pages*, and find your page. In the `<iframe>` snippet that you pasted into the page, make the following change:\\n\\n  Replace: `src=â€œhttps://assistant-integrations-{location}.watsonplatform.net/public/salesforcewebâ€�` with a url with this syntax:\\n\\n    ```code\\n    src=\"https://integrations.{location}.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud/public/salesforceweb/{integration-id}/agent_application?version=2020-09-24\"\\n    ```\\n    {: codeblock}\\n\\n  From the Web chat integration Salesforce live agent setup page, find the *Visualforce page markup* field. Look for the `src` parameter in the `<iframe>` element. It contains the full URL to use, including the appropriate `{location}` and `{integration-id}` values for your instance.\\n\\n- For a Slack integration that is over 7 months old, make sure the Request URL is using the proper endpoint.\\n\\n    - Go to the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/){: external} web page. Click *Your Apps* to find your assistant app. Click *Event Subscriptions* from the navigation pane.\\n    - Edit the Request URL.\\n\\n  For example, if the URL has the syntax: `https://assistant-slack-{location}.watsonplatform.net/public/message`, change it to have this syntax:\\n\\n  ```code\\n  https://integrations.{location}.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud/public/slack/{integration-id}/message?version=2020-09-24\\n  ```\\n  {: codeblock}\\n\\n  Check the *Generated request URL* field in the Slack integration setup page for the full URL to use, which includes the appropriate `{location}` and `{integration-id}` values for your instance.\\n\\n- For a Facebook Messenger integration that is over 7 months old, make sure the Callback URL is using the proper endpoint.\\n\\n    - Go to the [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/){: external} web page.\\n    - Open your app, and then select *Messenger>Settings* from the navigation pane.\\n    - Scroll down to the *Webhooks* section and edit the *Callback URL* field.\\n\\n      For example, if the URL has the syntax: `https://assistant-facebook-{location}.watsonplatform.net/public/message/`, change it to have this syntax:\\n\\n      ```code\\n      https://integrations.{location}.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud/public/facebook/{integration-id}/message?version=2020-09-24\\n      ```\\n      {: codeblock}\\n\\n      Check the *Generated callback URL* field in the Facebook Messenger integration setup page for the full URL to use, which includes the appropriate `{location}` and `{integration-id}` values for your instance.\\n\\n- For a Phone integration, if you connect to existing speech service instances, make sure those speech services use credentials that were generated with the latest endpoint syntax (a URL that starts with `https://api.{location}.speech-to-text.watson.cloud.ibm.com/`).\\n\\n- For a search skill, if you connect to an existing {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} service instance, make sure the {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} service uses credentials that were generated with the supported syntax (a URL that starts with `https://api.{location}.discovery.watson.cloud.ibm.com/`).\\n\\n- If you are using [Jupyter notebooks](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-logs-resources#logs-resources-jupyter-logs){: external} to do advanced analytics, check your Jupyter notebook files to make sure they don\\'t specify URLs with the old `watsonplatform.net` syntax. If so, update your files.\\n\\n- No action is required for the following integration types:\\n\\n    - Intercom\\n    - SMS with Twilio\\n    - WhatsApp with Twilio\\n    - Zendesk service desk connection from web chat\\n  \\n\\n 23 March 2021 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-mar232021}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Actions skill improvement\\n:   Actions have a new toolbar making it easier to send feedback, access settings, save, and close. \\n\\n 17 March 2021 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-mar172021}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Channel transfer response type\\n:   Dialog skills now include a channel transfer response type. If your assistant uses multiple integrations to support different channels for interaction with users, there might be some situations when a customer begins a conversation in one channel but then needs to transfer to a different channel. The most common such situation is transferring a conversation to the web chat integration, to take advantage of web chat features such as service desk integration. For more information, see  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview#dialog-overview-add-channel-transfer Adding a Channel transfer response type {: external}. \\n\\n Intercom and WhatsApp integrations now available in Lite plan\\n:   The integrations for Intercom and WhatsApp are now available in the Lite plan for {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}.

It is enabled by default. For more information about this feature, see  rect https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=tutorials-session-history Session history {: external}. \\n\\n  Session history persists within only one browser tab, not across multiple tabs. The dialog provides an option for links to open in a new tab or the same tab. See [this example](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=tutorials-session-history#Tutorial1){: external} for more information on how to format links to open in the same tab.\\n\\nSession history saves changes that are made to messages with the [pre:receive event](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-events#prereceive){: external} so that messages still look the same on rerender. This data is only saved for the length of the session. If you prefer to discard the data, set `event.updateHistory = false;` so the message is rerendered without the changes that were made in the pre:receive event.\\n\\n[instance.updateHistoryUserDefined()](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methods#updateHistoryUserDefined){: external} provides a way to save state for any message response. With the state saved, a response can be rerendered with the same state. This saved state is available in the `history.user_defined` section of the message response on reload. The data is saved during the user session. When the session expires, the data is discarded.\\n\\nTwo new history events, [history:begin](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-events#historybegin){: external} and [history:end](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-events#historyend){: external} announce the beginning and end of the history of a reloaded session. These events can be used to view the messages that are being reloaded. The history:begin event allows you to edit the messages before they are displayed.\\n\\nSee this example for more information on saving the state of [customResponse](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/testfest.html?to=api-events#customresponse){: external} types in session history.\\n  \\n\\n Channel switching\\n:   You can now create a dialog response type to functionally generate a connect-to-agent response within channels other than web chat. If a user is in a channel such as Slack or Facebook, they can trigger a channel transfer response type. The user receives a link that forwards them to your organization\\'s website where a connection to an agent response can be started within web chat.

Now it\\'s clearer that you have a choice to make about whether to always ask for the option value or to skip asking. For more information, see  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-actions#actions-response-types Apply reply constraints {: external}. \\n\\n 4 March 2021 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-mar042021}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Support for every language!\\n:   You now can build an assistant in any language you want to support. If a dedicated language model is not available for your target language, create a skill that uses the universal language model. The universal model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from training data written in the target language that you add to it. \\n\\n  The universal model is available as a beta feature. For more information, see [Understanding the universal language model](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language#watson-assistant-language-universal){: external}.\\n  \\n\\n Actions skill improvement\\n:   Now you can indicate whether or not to ask for a number when you apply a number reply constraint to a step. Test how changes to this setting might help speed up a customer\\'s interaction. Under the right circumstances, it can be useful to let a number mention be recognized and stored without having to explicitly ask the customer for it.

Previously, it was available from the context object as follows: \\n\\n  - v2: `context.global.system.user_id`\\n- v1: `context.metadata.user_id`\\n\\nThe property is now specified at the root of the `/message` request in addition to the context object. The built-in integrations typically set this property for you. If you\\'re using a custom application and don\\'t specify a `user_id`, the `user_id` is set to the `session_id` (v2) or `conversation_id`(v1) value.\\n  \\n\\n Digression bug fix\\n:   Fixed a bug where digression setting changes that were made to a node with slots were not being saved. \\n\\n 5 February 2021 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-feb052021}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Documentation update\\n:   The phone and  SMS with Twilio  deployment documentation was updated to include instructions for migrating from {{site.data.keyword.iva_short}}.

For example, \"festnetznummer\" (landline number) concatenates the words \"festnetz\" (landline) and \"nummer\" (number). When your customers chat with your assistant, they might write a compound word as a single word, as hyphenated words, or as separate words. Previously, the variants resulted in different intent confidence scores and different entity mention counts based on your training data. With the addition of the word decomposition function, the models now treat all compound word variants as equivalent. This update means you no longer need to add examples of every variant of the compound words to your training data.\\n  \\n\\n 19 January 2021 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-jan192021}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n The  Phone  and  SMS with Twilio  integrations are now generally available!\\n:   For more information, see: \\n\\n  - [Integrating with phone](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-phone){: external}\\n- [Integrating with *SMS with Twilio*](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-sms){: external}\\n  \\n\\n  Preview link  change\\n:   When you create a preview link, you can now test your skill from a chat window that is embedded in the page.

Support for the older technologies will end in June 2020. Take action now to test and adopt the new technologies, so your skills and assistants will be ready when the old technologies stop being supported. \\n\\n  The following technologies are being deprecated:\\n\\n- **Legacy version of numeric system entities**\\n\\n    We released a whole new infrastructure for our numeric system entities across all languages except Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Arabic. The updated `@sys-number`, `@sys-date`, `@sys-time`, `@sys-currency`, and `@sys-percentage` entities provide superior number recognition with higher precision. For more information about the new system entities, see [System entity details](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-system-entities){: external}.\\n\\n    The old version of the numeric system entities will stop being supported in June 2020 for English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish dialog skills.\\n\\n    ***Action***: In each dialog skill where you use numeric system entities, go to the **Options>System entities** page and turn on the new system entities. Take some time to test the new version of system entities with your own dialogs to make sure they continue to work as expected. As you adopt the new system entities, share your feedback about your experience with the new technology.\\n\\n- **Person and location system entities**\\n\\n    The `@sys-person` and `@sys-location` system entities, which were available in English as a beta only, are being deprecated. Consider using contextual entities as a way to capture these types of proper nouns. Instead of trying to add a dictionary-based entity that covers every permutation of the names for people or cities, for example, you can teach your skill to recognize the context in which such names are used. For more information about contextual entities, see [Annotation-based method](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities#entities-annotations-overview){: external}.\\n\\n    ***Action***: Remove references to `@sys-person` and `@sys-location` from your dialogs. Turn off the `@sys-person` and `@sys-location` system entities to prevent yourself or others from adding them to a dialog inadvertently.\\n\\n- **Irrelevance detection**\\n\\n    We revised the irrelevance detection classification algorithm to make it even smarter out of the box. Now, even before you begin to teach the system about irrelevant requests, it is able to recognize user input that your skill is not designed to address. For more information, see [Irrelevance detection](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-irrelevance-detection){: external}.\\n\\n    ***Action***: In each dialog skill, go to the **Options>Irrelevance detection** page and turn on the new classification model. Make sure everything works as well, if not better, than it did before. Share your feedback.\\n\\n- **Old API version dates**\\n\\n    v1 API versions that are dated on or before `2017-02-03` are being deprecated. When you send calls to the service with earlier API version dates, they will receive properly formatted and valid responses for a time, so you can gracefully transition to using the later API versions. However, the confidence scores and other results that are sent in the response will reflect those generated by a more recent version of the API.\\n\\n    ***Action***: Do some testing of calls with the latest version to verify that things work as expected. Some functionality has changed over the last few years. After testing, change the version date on any API calls that you make from your applications.\\n  \\n\\n 28 February 2020 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-feb282020}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n {{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}} is available in {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull_notm}}\\n:   The service can be installed on-premises in environments where {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull_notm}} 2.5 is installed on OpenShift or standalone.

Connections to private network endpoints do not require public internet access. For more information, see  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-security Protecting sensitive information {: external}. \\n\\n Full support for IBM Cloud IAM\\n:   {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} now supports the full implementation of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM). API keys for Watson services are no longer limited to a single service instance. You can create access policies and API keys that apply to more than one service, and you can grant access between services. \\n\\n  - To support this change, the API service endpoints use a different domain and include the service instance ID. The pattern is `api.{location}.{offering}.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/{instance_id}`.\\n\\n    Example URL for an instance hosted in the Dallas location: `api.us-south.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/6bbda3b3-d572-45e1-8c54-22d6ed9e52c2`\\n\\n    The previous public endpoint domain was `watsonplatform.net`.\\n\\n    For more information, see the [API reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2#service-endpoint){: external}.\\n\\n    These URLs do not introduce a breaking change. The new URLs work both for your existing service instances and for new instances.

The disambiguation feature shows it to customers if the assistant needs to ask them to clarify their meaning. The text you add as the node name must identify the purpose of the node clearly and succinctly, such as *Place an order* or *Get plan information*.\\n\\n    If the *External node name* field exists and contains a summary of the node\\'s purpose, then its summary is shown in the disambiguation list instead. Otherwise, the dialog node name content is shown.\\n\\n  - Disambiguation is enabled automatically for all nodes. You can disable it for the entire dialog or for individual dialog nodes.\\n\\n  - When testing, you might notice that the order of the options in the disambiguation list changes from one test run to the next. Don\\'t worry; this new behavior is intended. As part of work being done to help the assistant learn automatically from user choices, the order of the options in the disambiguation list is being randomized on purpose. Changing the order helps to avoid bias that can be introduced by a percentage of people who always pick the first option without first reviewing their choices.\\n  \\n\\n 12 November 2019 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-nov122019}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Slot prompt JSON editor\\n:   You can now use the context or JSON editors for the slot response field where you define the question that your assistant asks to get information it needs from the customer.

A new user interface library, which increases the page responsiveness, is being rolled out to existing service instances in phases. This search issue affects only dialog skills for which the new library is not yet enabled. \\n\\n Missing skills issue\\n:   In some cases, workspaces that were created through the API only are not being displayed when you open the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} user interface. Normally, these workspaces are displayed as dialog skills. If you do not see your skills from the UI, don\\'t worry; they are not gone.

The revised system entities offer better date and time understanding. They can recognize date and number spans, national holiday references, and classify mentions with more precision. For example, a date such as  May 15  is recognized as a date mention( @sys-date:2019-05-15 ), and is  not  also identified as a number mention ( @sys-number:15 ).

Customer inquiries that you did not anticipate and so have not built dialog logic to handle can be met with useful responses. Instead of saying it can\\'t help, the assistant can query an external data source to find relevant information to share in its response. Over time, you can build dialog responses to answer customer queries that require follow-up questions to clarify the user\\'s meaning or for which a short and clear response is suitable. And you can use search skill responses to address more open-ended customer queries that require a longer explanation. This beta feature is available to users of Premium and Plus service plans only. \\n\\n  See [Building a search skill](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-search-add){: external} for more details.\\n  \\n\\n 14 March 2019 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-mar142019}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n 4 March 2019 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-mar042019}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Simplified navigation\\n:   The sidebar navigation with separate  Build ,   Improve , and  Deploy  tabs has been removed. Now, you can get to all the tools you need to build a dialog skill from the main skill page. \\n\\n Improve page is now called Analytics\\n:   The informational metrics that Watson generates from conversations between your users and your assistant moved from the  Improve  tab of the sidebar to a new tab on the main skill page called  Analytics . \\n\\n 1 March 2019 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-mar012019}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n 28 February 2019 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-feb282019}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n New API version\\n:   The current API version is now  2019-02-28 . The following changes were made with this version: \\n\\n  - The order in which conditions are evaluated in nodes with slots has changed. Previously, if you had a node with slots that allowed for digressions away, the `anything_else` root node was triggered before any of the slot level Not found conditions could be evaluated. The order of operations has been changed to address this behavior. Now, when a user digresses away from a node with slots, all the root nodes except the `anything_else` node are processed. Next, the slot level Not found conditions are evaluated. And, finally, the root level `anything_else` node is processed. To better understand the full order of operations for a node with slots, see [Slot usage tips](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-slots#dialog-slots-node-level-handler){: external}.\\n\\n- Strings that begin with a number sign (#) in the `context` or `output` objects of a message are no longer treated as intent references.\\n\\n  Previously, these strings were treated as intents automatically. For example, if you specified a context variable, such as `\"color\":\"#FFFFFF\"`, then the hex color code (#FFFFFF) would be treated as an intent. Your assistant would check whether an intent named #FFFFFF was detected in the user\\'s input, and if not, would replace #FFFFFF with `false`. This replacement no longer occurs.\\n\\n  Similarly, if you included a number sign (#) in the text string in a node response, you used to have to escape it by preceding it with a back slash (`\\\\`). For example, `We are the \\\\#1 seller of lobster rolls in Maine.` You no longer need to escape the `#` symbol in a text response.\\n\\n  This change does not apply to node or condtional response conditions. Any strings that begin with a number sign (#) which are specified in conditions continue to be treated as intent references. Also, you can use SpEL expression syntax to force the system to treat a string in the `context` or `output` objects of a message as an intent. For example, specify the intent as `<? #intent-name ?>`.\\n  \\n\\n 25 February 2019 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-feb252019}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Slack integration enhancement\\n:   You can now choose the type of event that triggers your assistant in a Slack channel. Previously, when you integrated your assistant with Slack, the assistant interacted with users through a direct message channel. Now, you can configure the assistant to listen for mentions, and respond when it is mentioned in other channels. You can choose to use one or both event types as the mechanism through which your assistant interacts with users. \\n\\n 11 February 2019 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-feb112019}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Integrate with Intercom\\n:   Intercom, a leading customer service messaging platform, has partnered with IBM to add a new agent to the team, a virtual {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}.

This limit change was later reversed. If you created a Standard plan instance during the time frame in which the limit was in effect, your dialogs might be impacted. The limit was in effect for skills created between 10 December and 12 December 2018. The lower limits will be removed from all impacted instances in January.

Unlike previous plans, the Plus plan is a user-based billing plan. It measures usage by the number of unique users that interact with your assistant over a given time period. To get the most from the plan, if you build your own client application, design your app such that it defines a unique ID for each user, and passes the user ID with each /message API call. For the built-in integrations, the session ID is used to identify user interactions with the assistant.

Recommendations was a beta feature available to Premium plan users only. It recommended actions that users could take to improve their training data. Instead of consolidating recommendations in one place, recommendations are now being made available from the parts of the tool where you make actual training data changes. For example, while adding entity synonyms, you can now opt to see a list of synonymous terms that are recommended by Watson. If you are looking for other ways to analyze your user conversation logs in more detail, consider using Jupyter notebooks. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-logs-resources Advanced tasks {: external} for more details. \\n\\n 9 November 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-nov092018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Major user interface revision\\n:   The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service has a new look and added features. \\n\\n  This version of the tool was evaluated by beta program participants over the past several months.\\n\\n- **Skills**: What you think of as a *workspace* is now called a *skill*. A *dialog skill* is a container for the natural language processing training data and artifacts that enable your assistant to understand user questions, and respond to them.\\n\\n**Where are my workspaces?** Any workspaces that you created previously are now listed in your service instance as skills. Click the **Skills** tab to see them. For more information, see [Adding skills to your assistant](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add){: external}.\\n\\n- **Assistants**: You can now publish your skill in just two steps. Add your skill to an assistant, and then set up one or more integrations with which to deploy your skill. The assistant adds a layer of function to your skill that enables {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} to orchestrate and manage the flow of information for you. See [Assistants](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants){: external}.\\n\\n- **Built-in integrations**: Instead of going to the **Deploy** tab to deploy your workspace, you add your dialog skill to an assistant, and add integrations to the assistant through which the skill is made available to your users. You do not need to build a custom front-end application and manage the conversation state from one call to the next. However, you can still do so if you want to. See [Adding integrations](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-integration-add){: external} for more information.\\n\\n- **New major API version**: A V2 version of the API is available. This version provides access to methods you can use to interact with an assistant at run time. No more passing context with each API call; the session state is managed for you as part of the assistant layer.\\n\\nWhat is presented in the tooling as a dialog skill is effectively a wrapper for a V1 workspace. There are currently no API methods for authoring skills and assistants with the V2 API. However, you can continue to use the V1 API for authoring workspaces. See [API Overview](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-overview){: external} for more details.\\n\\n- **Switching data sources**: It is now easier to improve the model in one skill with user conversation logs from a different skill. You do not need to rely on deployment IDs, but can simply pick the name of the assistant to which a skill was added and deployed to use its data. See [Improving across assistants](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-logs#logs-deploy-id){: external}.\\n\\n- **Preview links from London instances**: If your service instance is hosted in London, then you must edit the preview link URL. The URL includes a region code for the region where the instance is hosted. Because instances in London are syndicated to Dallas, you must replace the `eu-gb` reference in the URL with `us-south` for the preview web page to render properly.\\n  \\n\\n 8 November 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-nov082018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Japanese data center\\n:   You can now create {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service instances that are hosted in the Tokyo data center. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-services-information#services-information-regions Data centers {: external} for more details. \\n\\n 30 October 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-oct302018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n New API authentication process\\n:   The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service transitioned from using Cloud Foundry to using token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication in the following regions: \\n\\n  - Dallas (us-south)\\n- Frankfurt (eu-de)\\n\\nFor new service instances, you use IAM for authentication. You can pass either a bearer token or an API key. Tokens support authenticated requests without embedding service credentials in every call. API keys use basic authentication.\\n\\nFor all existing service instances, you continue to use service credentials (`{username}:{password}`) for authentication.\\n  \\n\\n 25 October 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-oct252018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Entity synonym recommendations are available in more languages\\n:   Synonym recommendation support was added for the French, Japanese, and Spanish languages. \\n\\n 26 September 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-sep262018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n {{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}} is available in {{site.data.keyword.icpfull}}\\n:   {{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}} is available in {{site.data.keyword.icpfull}} \\n\\n 21 September 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-sep212018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n New API version\\n:   The current API version is now  2018-09-20 . In this version, the  errors[].path  attribute of the error object that is returned by the API is expressed as a  rect https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901 JSON Pointer {: external} instead of in dot notation form. \\n\\n Web actions support\\n:   You can now call {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} web actions from a dialog node. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-actions-client Making programmatic calls from a dialog node {: external} for more details. \\n\\n 15 August 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-aug152018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Entity fuzzy matching support improvements\\n:   Fuzzy matching is fully supported for English entities, and the misspelling feature is no longer a Beta-only feature for many other languages. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support Supported languages {: external} for details. \\n\\n 6 August 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-aug062018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Intent conflict resolution\\n:   The tool can now help you to resolve conflicts when two or more user examples in separate intents are similar to one another. Non-distinct user examples can weaken the training data and make it harder for your assistant to map user input to the appropriate intent at run time. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents#intents-resolve-conflicts Resolving intent conflicts {: external} for details. \\n\\n Disambiguation\\n:   Enable disambiguation to allow your assistant to ask the user for help when it needs to decide between two or more viable dialog nodes to process for a response. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime#dialog-runtime-disambiguation Disambiguation {: external} for more details. \\n\\n Jump-to fix\\n:   Fixed a bug in the Dialogs tool which prevented you from being able to configure a jump-to that targets the response of a node with the  anything_else  special condition. \\n\\n Digression return message\\n:   You can now specify text to display when the user returns to a node after a digression. The user will have seen the prompt for the node already. You can change the message slightly to let users know they are returning to where they left off. For example, specify a response like,  Where were we? Oh, yes...  See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime#dialog-runtime-digressions Digressions {: external} for more details. \\n\\n 12 July 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-jul122018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Rich response types\\n:   You can now add rich responses that include elements such as images or buttons in addition to text, to your dialog. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview#dialog-overview-multimedia Rich responses {: external} for more information. \\n\\n Contextual entities (Beta)\\n:   Contextual entities are entities that you define by labeling mentions of the entity type that occur in intent user examples. These entity types teach your assistant not only terms of interest, but also the context in which terms of interest typically appear in user utterances, enabling your assistant to recognize never-seen-before entity mentions based solely on how they are referenced in user input. For example, if you annotate the intent user example,  I want a flight to Boston  by labeling  Boston  as a  @destination  entity, then your assistant can recognize  Chicago  as a  @destination  mention in a user input that says,  I want a flight to Chicago.  This feature is currently available for English only. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities#entities-create-annotation-based Adding contextual entities {: external} for more information. \\n\\n  When you access the tool with an Internet Explorer web browser, you cannot label entity mentions in intent user examples nor edit user example text.\\n  \\n\\n Entity recommendations\\n:   Watson can now recommend synonyms for your entity values. The recommender finds related synonyms based on contextual similarity extracted from a vast body of existing information, including large sources of written text, and uses natural language processing techniques to identify words similar to the existing synonyms in your entity value. For more information see  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities#entities-create-dictionary-based Synonyms {: external}. \\n\\n New API version\\n:   The current API version is now  2018-07-10 . This version introduces the following changes: \\n\\n  - The content of the /message `output` object changed from being a `text` JSON object to being a `generic` array that supports multiple rich response types, including `image`, `option`, `pause`, and `text`.\\n- Support for contextual entities was added.\\n- You can no longer add user-defined properties in `context.metadata`. However, you can add them directly to `context`.\\n  \\n\\n Overview page date filter\\n:   Use the new date filters to choose the period for which data is displayed. These filters affect all data shown on the page: not just the number of conversations displayed in the graph, but also the statistics displayed along with the graph, and the lists of top intents and entities. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-logs-overview#logs-overview-controls Controls {: external} for more information. \\n\\n Pattern limit expanded\\n:   When using the  Patterns  field to  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities#entities-patterns define specific patterns for an entity value {: external}, the pattern (regular expression) is now limited to 512 characters. \\n\\n 2 July 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-jul022018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Jump-tos from conditional responses\\n:   You can now configure a conditional response to jump directly to another node. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview#dialog-overview-multiple Conditional responses {: external} for more details. \\n\\n 21 June 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-jun212018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Language updates for system entities\\n:   Dutch and Simplified Chinese language support are now generally available. Dutch language support includes fuzzy matching for misspellings. Traditional Chinese language support includes the availability of  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-system-entities system entities {: external} in beta release. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support Supported languages {: external} for details. \\n\\n 14 June 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-jun142018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Washington, DC data center opens\\n:   You can now create {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service instances that are hosted in the Washington, DC data center. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-services-information#services-information-regions Data centers {: external} for more details. \\n\\n New API authentication process\\n:   The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service has a new API authentication process for service instances that are hosted in the following regions: \\n\\n  - Washington, DC (us-east) as of 14 June 2018\\n- Sydney, Australia (au-syd) as of 7 May 2018\\n\\n{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} is migrating to token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication.\\n\\nFor new service instances in the regions listed, you use IAM for authentication. You can pass either a bearer token or an API key. Tokens support authenticated requests without embedding service credentials in every call. API keys use basic authentication.\\n\\nFor all new and existing service instances in other regions, you continue to use service credentials (`{username}:{password}`) for authentication.\\n\\nWhen you use any of the Watson SDKs, you can pass the API key and let the SDK manage the lifecycle of the tokens. For more information and examples, see [Authentication](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2#authentication){: external} in the API reference.\\n\\nIf you are not sure which type of authentication to use, view the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} credentials by clicking the service instance from the Services section of the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com){: external}.\\n  \\n\\n 25 May 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-may252018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n New sample workspace\\n:   The sample workspace that is provided for you to explore or to use as a starting point for your own workspace has changed. The  Car Dashboard  sample was replaced by a  Customer Service  sample. The new sample showcases how to use content catalog intents and other newer features to build a bot. It can answer common questions, such as inquiries about store hours and locations, and illustrates how to use a node with slots to schedule in-store appointments. \\n\\n HTML rendering was added to Try it out\\n:   The \"Try it out\" pane now renders HTML formatting that is included in response text. Previously, if you included a hypertext link as an HTML anchor tag in a text response, you would see the HTML source in the \"Try it out\" pane during testing. It used to look like this: \\n\\n  `Contact us at <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com\">ibm.com</a>.`\\n\\nNow, the hypertext link is rendered as if on a web page. It is displayed like this:\\n\\n`Contact us at` [ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com){: external}.\\n\\nRemember, you must use the appropriate type of syntax in your responses for the client application to which you will deploy the conversation. Only use HTML syntax if your client application can interpret it properly. Other integration channels might expect other formats.\\n  \\n\\n Deployment changes\\n:   The  Test in Slack  option was removed. \\n\\n 11 May 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-may112018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Information security\\n:   The documentation includes some new details about data privacy. Read more in  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-information-security Information security {: external}. \\n\\n 7 May 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-may072018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Sydney, Australia data center opens\\n:   You can now create {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service instances that are hosted in the Sydney, Australia data center. See  rect https://www.ibm.com/cloud/data-centers/ IBM Cloud global data centers {: external} for more details. \\n\\n 4 April 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-apr042018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Search dialogs\\n:   You can now  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-tasks#dialog-tasks-search search dialog nodes {: external} for a given word or phrase. \\n\\n 15 March 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-mar152018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Introducing {{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}}\\n:   {{site.data.keyword.ibmwatson}} Conversation has been renamed. It is now called {{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}}. The name change reflects the fact that {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} is expanding to provide prebuilt content and tools that help you more easily share the virtual assistants you build. Read  rect https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2018/03/the-future-of-watson-conversation-watson-assistant/ this blog post {: external} for more details. \\n\\n New REST APIs and SDKs are available for {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}\\n:   The new APIs are functionally identical to the existing Conversation APIs, which continue to be supported. For more information about the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} APIs, see the  rect https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v1 API Reference {: external}. \\n\\n Dialog enhancements\\n:   The following features were added to the dialog tool: \\n\\n  - Simple variable name and value fields are now available that you can use to add context variables or update context variable values. You do not need to open the JSON editor unless you want to. See [Defining a context variable](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime-context#dialog-runtime-context-var-define){: external} for more details.\\n- Organize your dialog by using folders to group together related dialog nodes. See [Organizing the dialog with folders](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-tasks#dialog-tasks-folders){: external} for more details.\\n- Support was added for customizing how each dialog node participates in user-initiated digressions away from the designated dialog flow. See [Digressions](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime#dialog-runtime-digressions){: external} for more details.\\n  \\n\\n Search intents and entities\\n:   A new search feature has been added that allows you to  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents#intents-search search intents {: external} for user examples, intent names, or descriptions, or to  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities#entities-search search entity {: external} values and synonyms. \\n\\n Content catalogs\\n:   The new  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-catalog#catalog-add content catalogs {: external} contain a single category of prebuilt common intents and entities that you can add to your application. For example, most applications require a general #greeting-type intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add it from the content catalog rather than building your own. \\n\\n Enhanced user metrics\\n:   The Improve component has been enhanced with additional user metrics and logging statistics. For example, the Overview page includes several new, detailed graphs that summarize interactions between users and your application, the amount of traffic for a given time period, and the intents and entities that were recognized most often in user conversations. \\n\\n 12 March 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-mar122018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n New date and time methods\\n:   Methods were added that make it easier to perform date calculations from the dialog. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-methods#dialog-methods-date-time-calculations Date and time calculations {: external} for more details. \\n\\n 16 February 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-feb162018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Dialog node tracing\\n:   When you use the \"Try it out\" pane to test a dialog, a location icon is displayed next to each response. You can click the icon to highlight the path that your assistant traversed through the dialog tree to arrive at the response. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-tasks#dialog-tasks-test Building a dialog {: external} for details. \\n\\n New API version\\n:   The current API version is now  2018-02-16 . This version introduces the following changes: \\n\\n  - A new `include_audit` parameter is now supported on most GET requests. This is an optional boolean parameter that specifies whether the response should include the audit properties (`created` and `updated` timestamps). The default value is `false`. (If you are using an API version earlier than `2018-02-16`, the default value is `true`.) For more information, see the [API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v1){: external}.\\n\\n- Responses from API calls using the new version include only properties with non-`null` values.\\n\\n- The `output.nodes_visited` and `output.nodes_visited_details` properties of message responses now include nodes with the following types, which were previously omitted:\\n\\n- Nodes with `type`=`response_condition`\\n- Nodes with `type`=`event_handler` and `event_name`=`input`\\n  \\n\\n 9 February 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-feb092018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Dutch system entities (Beta)\\n:   Dutch language support has been enhanced to include the availability of  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-system-entities System entities {: external} in beta release. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support Supported languages {: external} for details. \\n\\n 29 January 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-jan292018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n \\t The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} REST API now supports new request parameters: \\t Use the  append  parameter when updating a workspace to indicate whether the new workspace data should be added to the existing data, rather than replacing it. For more information, see  rect https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v1?curl=#update-workspace Update workspace {: external}. \\n\\t Use the  nodes_visited_details  parameter when sending a message to indicate whether the response should include additional diagnostic information about the nodes that were visited during processing of the message. For more information, see  rect https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v1?curl=#message Send message {: external}. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n 23 January 2018 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-jan232018}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Unable to retrieve list of workspaces\\n:   If you see this or similar error messages when working in the tooling, it might mean that your session has expired. Log out by choosing  Log out  from the  User information  icon, and then log back in. \\n\\n 8 December 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-dec082017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Log data access across instances (Premium users only)\\n:   If you are a {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} Premium user, your premium instances can optionally be configured to allow access to log data from workspaces across your different premium instances. \\n\\n Copy nodes\\n:   You can now duplicate a node to make a copy of it and its children. This feature is helpful if you build a node with useful logic that you want to reuse elsewhere in your dialog. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-tasks#dialog-tasks-copy-node Copying a dialog node {: external} for more information. \\n\\n Capture groups in pattern entities\\n:   You can identify groups in the regular expression pattern that you define for an entity. Identifying groups is useful if you want to be able to refer to a subsection of the pattern later. For example, your entity might have a regex pattern that captures US phone numbers. If you identify the area code segment of the number pattern as a group, then you can subsequently refer to that group to access just the area code segment of a phone number. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities#entities-creating-task Defining entities {: external} for more information. \\n\\n 6 December 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-dec062017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} integration (Beta)\\n:   Call {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} (formerly IBM OpenWhisk) actions directly from a dialog node. This feature enables you to, for example, call an action to retrieve weather information from within a dialog node, and then condition on the returned information in the dialog response. Currently, you can call an action from a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} instance that is hosted in the US South region from {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} instances that are hosted in the US South region. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-actions-client Making programmatic calls from a dialog node {: external} for more details. \\n\\n 5 December 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-dec052017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Redesigned UI for Intents and Entities\\n:   The  Intents  and  Entities  tabs have been redesigned to provide an easier, more efficient workflow when creating and editing entities and intents. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents-create-task Defining intents {: external} and  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities#entities-creating-task Defining entities {: external} for information about working with these tabs. \\n\\n 30 November 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-nov302017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Eastern Arabic numeral support\\n:   Eastern Arabic numerals are now supported in Arabic system entities. \\n\\n 29 November 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-nov292017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Improving understanding of user input across workspaces\\n:   You can now improve a workspace with utterances that were sent to other workspaces within your instance. For example, you might have multiple versions of production workspaces and development workspaces; you can use the same utterance data to improve any of these workspaces. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-logs#logs-deploy-id Improving across workspaces {: external}. \\n\\n 20 November 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-nov202017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n GB18030 compliance\\n:   GB18030 is a Chinese standard that specifies an extended code page for use in the Chinese market. This code page standard is important for the software industry because the China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee has mandated that any software application that is released for the Chinese market after September 1, 2001, be enabled for GB18030. The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service supports this encoding, and is certified GB18030-compliant. \\n\\n 9 November 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-nov092017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Intent examples can directly reference entities\\n:   You can now specify an entity reference directly in an intent example. That entity reference, along with all its values or synonyms, is used by the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service classifier for training the intent. For more information, see  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents#intents-entity-as-example  Entity as example  {: external} in the  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents Intents {: external} topic. \\n\\n  Currently, you can only directly reference closed entities that you define. You cannot directly reference [pattern entities](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities#entities-patterns) or [system entities](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-system-entities){: external}.\\n  \\n\\n 8 November 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-nov082017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} connector\\n:   You can use the new {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} connector tool to connect your workspace to a Slack or Facebook Messenger app that you own, making it available as a chatbot that Slack or Facebook Messenger users can interact with. This tool is available only for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} US South region. \\n\\n 3 November 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-nov032017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Dialog updates\\n:   The following updates make is easier for you to build a dialog. (See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build Building a dialog {: external} for details.) \\n\\n  - You can add a condition to a slot to make it required only if certain conditions are met. For example, you can make a slot that asks for the name of a spouse required only if a previous (required) slot that asks for marital status indicates that the user is married.\\n\\n- You can now choose **Skip user input** as the next step for a node. When you choose this option, after processing the current node, your assistant jumps directly to the first child node of the current node. This option is similar to the existing *Jump to* next step option, except that it allows for more flexibility. You do not need to specify the exact node to jump to. At run time, your assistant always jumps to whichever node is the first child node, even if the child nodes are reordered or new nodes are added after the next step behavior is defined.\\n\\n- You can add conditional responses for slots. For both Found and Not found responses, you can customize how your assistant responds based on whether certain conditions are met. This feature enables you to check for possible misinterpretations and correct them before saving the value provided by the user in the slot\\'s context variable. For example, if the slot saves the user\\'s age, and uses `@sys-number` in the *Check for* field to capture it, you can add a condition that checks for numbers over 100, and responds with something like, *Please provide a valid age in years.* See [Adding conditions to Found and Not found responses](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-slots#dialog-slots-handler-next-steps){: external} for more details.\\n\\n- The interface you use to add conditional responses to a node has been redesigned to make it easier to list each condition and its response. To add node-level conditional responses, click **Customize**, and then enable the **Multiple responses** option.\\n\\n The **Multiple responses** toggle sets the feature on or off for the node-level response only. It does not control the ability to define conditional responses for a slot. The slot multiple response setting is controlled separately.\\n\\n- To keep the page where you edit a slot simple, you now select menu options to a.) add a condition that must be met for the slot to be processed, and b.) add conditional responses for the Found and Not found conditions for a slot. Unless you choose to add this extra functionality, the slot condition and multiple responses fields are not displayed, which declutters the page and makes it easier to use.\\n  \\n\\n 25 October 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-oct252017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Updates to Simplified Chinese\\n:   Language support has been enhanced for Simplified Chinese. This includes intent classification improvements using character-level word embeddings, and the availability of system entities. Note that the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service learning models may have been updated as part of this enhancement, and when you retrain your model any changes will be applied. \\n\\n Updates to Spanish\\n:   Improvements have been made to Spanish intent classification, for very large datasets. \\n\\n 11 October 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-oct112017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Updates to Korean\\n:   Language support has been enhanced for Korean.

This can help you identify entities that follow a defined pattern, for example SKU or part numbers, phone numbers, or email addresses. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities#entities-patterns Pattern-defined entities {: external} for additional details. \\n\\n  - You can add either synonyms or patterns for a single entity value; you cannot add both.\\n- For each entity value, there can be a maximum of up to 5 patterns.\\n- Each pattern (regular expression) is limited to 128 characters.\\n- Importing or exporting via a CSV file does not currently support patterns.\\n- The REST API does not support direct access to patterns, but you can retrieve or modify patterns using the `/values` endpoint.\\n  \\n\\n Fuzzy matching filtered by dictionary (English only)\\n:   An improved version of fuzzy matching for entities is now available, for English. This improvement prevents the capturing of some common, valid English words as fuzzy matches for a given entity. For example, fuzzy matching will not match the entity value  like  to  hike  or  bike , which are valid English words, but will continue to match examples such as  lkie  or  oike . \\n\\n 27 September 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-sep272017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Condition builder updates\\n:   The control that is displayed to help you define a condition in a dialog node has been updated. Enhancements include support for listing available context variable names after you enter the $ to begin adding a context variable. \\n\\n 31 August 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-aug312017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Improve section rollback\\n:   The median conversation time metric, and corresponding filters, are being temporarily removed from the Overview page of the Improve section. This removal will prevent the calculation of certain metrics from causing the median conversation time metric, and the conversations over time graph, to display inaccurate information. IBM regrets removing functionality from the tool, but is committed to ensuring that we are communicating accurate information to users. \\n\\n Dialog node names\\n:   You can now assign any name to a dialog node; it does not need to be unique. And you can subsequently change the node name without impacting how the node is referenced internally. The name you specify is saved as a title attribute of the node in the workspace JSON file and the system uses a unique ID that is stored in the name attribute to reference the node. \\n\\n 23 August 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-aug232017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Updates to Korean, Japanese, and Italian\\n:   Language support has been enhanced for Korean, Japanese, and Italian. Note that the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service learning models may have been updated as part of this enhancement, and when you retrain your model any changes will be applied. \\n\\n 10 August 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-aug102017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Accent normalization\\n:   In a conversational setting, users may or may not use accents while interacting with the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service. As such, an update has been made to the algorithm so that accented and non-accented versions of words are treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition. \\n\\n  However, for some languages like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity may implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\\n\\nFor example, for the word `barriÃ³`, which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb `barrer` (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word `barrio` (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\\n\\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, `barrio` will not be detected if `barriÃ³` is in the training set; and `barriÃ³` will not be detected if `barrio` is in the training set.\\n\\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents. For example, if you are expecting `barriÃ³` as a response, then you should put `barriÃ³` into the training set.\\n\\nAlthough not an accent mark, the same applies to words using, for example, the Spanish letter `Ã±` vs. the letter `n`, such as `uÃ±a` vs. `una`. In this case the letter `Ã±` is not simply an `n` with an accent; it is a unique, Spanish-specific letter.\\n\\nYou can enable fuzzy matching if you think your customers will not use the appropriate accents, or misspell words (including, for example, putting a `n` instead of a `Ã±`), or you can explicitly include them in the training examples.\\n\\n**Note:** Accent normalization is enabled for Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Czech.\\n  \\n\\n Workspace opt-out flag\\n:   The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} REST API now supports an opt-out flag for workspaces. This flag indicates that workspace training data such as intents and entities are not to be used by IBM for general service improvements.

Previously, you had to create several dialog nodes to cover all the possible combinations of ways that users might provide the information. With slots, you can configure a single node that saves any information that the user provides, and prompts for any required details that the user does not. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-slots Gathering information with slots {: external} for more details. \\n\\n Simplified dialog tree\\n:   The dialog tree has been redesigned to improve its usability. The tree view is more compact so it is easier to see where you are within it. And the links between nodes are represented in a way that makes it easier to understand the relationships between the nodes. \\n\\n 21 June 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-jun212017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Arabic support\\n:   Language support for Arabic is now generally available.

You can turn on fuzzy matching per entity to improve the ability of your assistant to recognize terms in user input with syntax that is similar to the entity, without requiring an exact match. The feature is able to map user input to the appropriate corresponding entity despite the presence of misspellings or slight syntactical differences. For example, if you define giraffe as a synonym for an animal entity, and the user input contains the terms giraffes or girafe, the fuzzy match is able to map the term to the animal entity correctly. See  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities#entities-fuzzy-matching Fuzzy matching {: external} for details. \\n\\n 13 June 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-jun132017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n User conversations\\n:   The Improve panel now includes a  User conversations  page, which provides a list of user interactions with your chatbot that can be filtered by keyword, intent, entity, or number of days. You can open individual conversations to correct intents, or to add entity values or synonyms. \\n\\n Regex change\\n:   The regular expressions that are supported by SpEL functions like find, matches, extract, replaceFirst, replaceAll and split have changed. A group of regular expression constructs are no longer allowed, including look-ahead, look-behind, possessive repetition and backreference constructs. This change was necessary to avoid a security exposure in the original regular expression library. \\n\\n 12 June 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-jun122017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Updates\\n:   This release includes the following updates:\\n    - The maximum number of workspaces that you can create with the  Lite  plan (formerly named the Free plan) changed from 3 to 5.\\n    - You can now assign any name to a dialog node; it does not need to be unique. And you can subsequently change the node name without impacting how the node is referenced internally. The name you specify is treated as an alias and the system uses its own internal identifier to reference the node.\\n    - You can no longer change the language of a workspace after you create it by editing the workspace details. If you need to change the language, you can export the workspace as a JSON file, update the language property, and then import the JSON file as a new workspace. \\n\\n 6 June 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-jun062017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Learn\\n:   A new  Learn about {{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}}  page is available that provides getting started information and links to service documentation and other useful resources. To open the page, click the icon in the page header. \\n\\n Bulk export and delete\\n:   You can now simultaneously export a number of intents or entities to a CSV file, so you can then import and reuse them for another {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} application. You can also simultaneously select a number of entities or intents for deletion in bulk. \\n\\n Updates to Korean\\n:   Korean tokenizers have been updated to address informal language support. IBM continues to work on improvements to entity recognition and classification. \\n\\n Emoji support\\n:   Emojis added to intent examples, or as entity values, will now be correctly classified/extracted. \\n\\n  Only emojis that are included in your training data will be correctly and consistently identified; emoji support may not correctly classify similar emojis with different color tones or other variations.\\n  \\n\\n Entity stemming (Beta - English only)\\n:   The fuzzy matching beta feature recognizes entities and matches them based on the stem form of the entity value. For example, this feature correctly recognizes  bananas  as being similar to  banana , and  run  being similar to  running  as they share a common stem form. For more information, see  rect /docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities#entities-fuzzy-matching Fuzzy matching {: external}. \\n\\n Workspace import progress\\n:   When you import a workspace from a JSON file, a tile for the workspace is displayed immediately, in which information about the progress of the import is displayed. \\n\\n Reduced training time\\n:   Multiple models are now trained in parallel, which noticeably reduces the training time for large workspaces. \\n\\n 26 May 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-may262017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n New API version\\n:   The current API version is now  2017-05-26 . This version introduces the following changes: \\n\\n  - The schema of ErrorResponse objects has changed. This change affects all endpoints and methods. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant){: external}.\\n- The internal schema used to represent dialog nodes in exported workspace JSON has changed. If you use the `2017-05-26` API to import a workspace that was exported using an earlier version, some dialog nodes might not import correctly. For best results, always import a workspace using the same version that was used to export it.\\n  \\n\\n 25 May 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-may252017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Manage context variables\\n:   You can now manage context variables in the \"Try it out\" pane.

To use the sample as a starting point for your own workspace, edit the workspace. If you want to use it for multiple workspaces, then duplicate it instead. The sample workspace does not count toward your subscription workspace total unless you use it.\\n- It is now easier to navigate the tool. The navigation menu options are available from the side of the main page instead of the top. In the page header, breadcrumb links display that show you where you are. You can now switch between service instances from the Workspaces page. To get there quickly, click **Back to workspaces** from the navigation menu. If you have multiple service instances, the name of the current instance is displayed. You can click the **Change** link beside it to choose another instance.\\n- When you create a dialog, two nodes are now added to it for you: 1) a **Welcome** node at the start the dialog tree that contains the greeting to display to the user and 2) an **Anything else** node at the end of the tree that catches any user inquiries that are not recognized by other nodes in the dialog and responds to them. See [Creating a dialog](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build){: external} for more details.\\n- When you are testing a dialog in the \"Try it out\" pane, you can now find and resubmit a recent test utterance by pressing the Up key to cycle through your previous inputs.\\n- Experimental Korean language support for 5 system entities (`@sys-date`, `@sys-time`, `@sys-currency`, `@sys-number`, `@sys-percentage`) is now available. There are known issues for some of the numeric entities, and limited support for informal language input.\\n- An Overview page is available from the Improve tab. The page provides a summary of interactions with your bot.

To benefit from the changes, you must manually upgrade your workspace.\\n\\n- The processing of **Jump to** actions changed to prevent loops that can occur under certain conditions. Previously, if you jumped to the condition of a node and neither that node nor any of its peer nodes had a condition that was evaluated as true, the system would jump to the root-level node and look for a node whose condition matched the input. In some situations this processing created a loop, which prevented the dialog from progressing.\\n\\n Under the new process, if neither the target node nor its peers is evaluated as true, the dialog turn is ended. To reimplement the old model, add a final peer node with a condition of `true`. In the response, use a **Jump to** action that targets the condition of the first node at the root level of your dialog tree.\\n  \\n\\n 11 January 2017 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-jan112017}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Customize node titles\\n:   In this release, you can customize node titles in dialog. \\n\\n 22 December 2016 \\n\\n {: #watson-assistant-dec222016}\\n{: release-note} \\n\\n Node title section\\n:   In this release, dialog nodes display a new section for  node title .

Lots of exciting new features to manage your assistant’s lifecycle, and bring value to your clients, are available through the new experience and the V2 API. \\n If you find yourself stuck using the V1 API because you fear what changes lie lurking in the new experience, I’m going to, hopefully, illustrate how to leverage the V2 API in your application and give you the confidence to make the switch! \\n Let’s review how to get up and running with the V1 API. We will step through, in painstaking detail, what requests and responses are involved in creating your workspace, ensuring the natural language understanding (NLU) models have been successfully trained, and leveraging the models to classify utterances provided by a user. That journey looks like the following: \\n A workspace is the fundamental building block of the V1 API. All training data used in intent classification and entity detection is provided as part of a workspace. \\n To get started, a user must create a workspace with relevant data. \\n Once a workspace is created, the system will begin to train a set of machine learning (ML) and NLU models based on the included training data. Before the /message endpoint can be used, we want to ensure the NLU models are Available. \\n Once the NLU models areAvailable, we are ready to invoke the /message API. A V1 /message API request is composed of three types of information: \\n input determines how the system processes the request. It contains the “utterance” of the user (input.text) plus optional flags that influence the processing or response of the API call. \\n context is additional information that can be associated with the multi-turn conversation throughout its duration and be leveraged by client applications. It does NOT influence the behavior of Watson Assistant when processing a request. \\n user_id is a unique identifier for a given user interacting with your assistant. While the system provides a randomly generated string if this value is not specified, it is a good idea for your system to identify users. The majority of Watson Assistant plans are billed based on “users” as identified by this attribute — so relying on randomly generated identifiers can lead to unnecessary charges to your IBM Cloud account! \\n For an initial /message API request, it’s likely context is not very interesting. \\n The response for the above request contains a lot more information because of the system processing the message. \\n To help understand what is being returned, let’s break the response into two groups: everything except context and context. \\n First, the non-context information: \\n Now, the context information: \\n Based on the example above, any subsequent /message API request needs to “carry forward” the context. While user defined attributes can be modified, conversation_id, system, and metadata should be preserved. \\n This propagation of context into a subsequent /message API request is what we refer to as V1 /message being “stateless”. The system does not remember any stateful information from one /message API request to the next, meaning all the necessary information must be provided by the client to advance a multi-turn conversation. \\n The response for the above request contains information similar to what we saw on the initial request, but relevant to the specific point of the conversation based on the dialog_nodes configuration. \\n Again, we will first look at the non-context information: \\n And now, context. \\n Congratulations, you are now intimately familiar with the structure of the V1 /message API! \\n Let’s “up the ante” and take a similarly analytical approach to the V2 API. \\n Building on the prior section, a comparable V2 workflow has an additional step. First, an assistant is created (which automatically creates a draft and liveenvironment), then an actions skill. \\n Then, we are on more familiar footing: the training status needs to be checked to confirm various NLU models are available before user utterances can be analyzed. Again, for the “picture people” out there, the following diagram illustrates what we are going to work through. \\n While in V1 a workspace was the fundamental building block of the API, the V2 API has been designed to handle more complex use cases. The V2 API works seamlessly over a variety of channels, integrations, and customer-defined webhooks. With extensibility a design point, the API can more easily adapt to future functional enhancements with minimal effort required for customers to adopt. \\n In V2, the fundamental building blocks are skills and environments. \\n The assistant is then the container for skills, environments, and other resources that help create and manage a production assistant. Again, the assistant does not orchestrate messages — that role is served by an environment. \\n Assistants define the scope in which a skill may be accessed. For skills to be invoked via /message, a skill must be assigned to an environment. This relationship between a skill and an environment is referred to in the API as a skill reference. \\n To get started in V2, a user need only create an assistant. Once the assistant is created, the system will automatically : \\n While all this might seem like information overload, getting up and running has never been easier through the New Watson Assistant experience! As we dive into what this looks like from an API experience to compare and contrast with the V1 perspective, please note not all the APIs I reference here are publicly available (yet). For those that are not publicly available, the Watson Assistant Tooling serves those use cases well. \\n ℹ️ The following use case, for simplicity, will only leverage the draft environment. Working amongst different environments within an assistant will be covered in a later article. \\n First, we create an assistant: \\n With an assistant created, we can now add a dialog skill to do a more apples-to-apples comparison to the V1 scenario above. \\n While the New Watson Assistant experience prefers the actions skill as the training data container, a dialog skill can be added alongside the actions skill to help support established systems. When a dialog skill is active on the assistant, it acts the primary skill and can delegate to the actions skill where appropriate. \\n As with V1, you want to make sure your skill has finished training before invoking the V2 /message API. While the Watson Assistant Tooling provides a beautiful banner to keep you informed, a peek behind the curtain from an API standpoint looks like this: \\n With our assistant now configured with a properly trained dialog skill, we are ready to invoke the V2 /message API! To appreciate the differences in V2, we will replicate the same scenario we played out for the V1 API analysis. \\n Before we start to to dive into JSON payloads again, I want to briefly call out another important difference in the V2 API. The /message API in V2 comes in 2 different varieties: \\n Please note the following examples will leverage the stateless variant of the V2 /message API. Now, lets starts to see what this looks like in practice by sending our initial call! \\n ⚠️ One last explanatory interlude: \\n In the following screenshots, a discerning reader may notice and wonder why we are providing the environment_id value in the v2/assistants/{id}/message endpoint. \\n This is supported in order to allow existing customers to adopt the the new Watson Assistant experience with limited changes. In time, we will be rolling out a POST v2/assistants/{assistant_id}/environments/{environment_id}/message endpoint that more naturally maps to the new data model. \\n Let’s dive into the response. Again, as we did with V1, let’s break the response into two groups: everything except context and context. \\n With the V1 response in mind, there are a few key differences to call out here: \\n Next, the context information: \\n This is a significant departure from the V1 context but enables greater extensibility and coherency. Let’s look into what is going on here: \\n As with the V1 API, any subsequent /message API request needs to “carry forward” the context. While context.skills.* skill.user_defined attributes can be modified, context.global.system and context.skills.* skill.system values should be preserved. \\n This example, in order to align with what was outlined in the V1 API, leverages the V2 stateless /message API. As such, propagation of context into a subsequent /message API request is still necessary. Out of scope to this article, there is also a stateful variant of the /message API available in V2. \\n Once again, we will first look at the non-context information of the response: \\n The explanation of the above attributes is identical to the analysis of initial V2 /message API invocation. As with V1, the actions attribute present in the output attribute of the response is due to a Dialog Callout I have configured on the dialog_node of the dialog skill that handled this request. \\n And, lastly, the context information. \\n No real surprises here. The explanation of the above is identical to the analysis of initial V2 /message API invocation. \\n Pat yourself on the back. That was an intensive API overview. \\n Let’s summarize everything we have discussed and highlight some additional differences not covered in the trivial example above. \\n Following the Pareto Principle, it is not unreasonable to assume this review of the differences between V1 and V2 API behavior covers 80% of the use cases a client would be interested in. That said, failure to appreciate differences on (API) paths less travelled can still result in a very frustrating debugging experience for a Watson Assistant customer, and potentially an unhappy user of that customer’s assistant. \\n In the interest of complete disclosure, the following tables outline all the differences you can expect on request and response payloads: \\n Until now, we have focused on the major API version differences. However, there is an additional piece to this puzzle: the minor API version. While minor versions are “tweaks” (whereas major versions are typically complete overhauls), failure to account for minor API version differences can still break your application! \\n It’s not far-fetched to think, for an established customer that has been happy with Watson Assistant, that a given client application is not using the latest supported minor API version. While minor API version releases are always documented in the IBM Watson Assistant Release Notes, there is a lot of other information unrelated to the API that is documented. This makes it sometimes tricky to identify what you should be aware of when upgrading from an old minor version. \\n Lucky for you, I have done all the necessary scrolling and squinting required to summarize the relevant API changes below! Changes come in a couple different flavors: \\n I have tried to explicitly call out what type of changes occur in each API version in the table below.- The Release Notes column is a link to the official Watson Assistant Release Notes for the given API version. \\n \\n  ']\n",

As Watson Assistant has grown and progressed over the last decade, the product has become more capable, but the refinement of the end-to-end experience hasn’t always kept pace. \\n Feedback from our users helped us recognize that we were in need of a more streamlined, user-friendly, user-focused experience that would make implementing and using Watson Assistant not just approachable but delightful. This was particularly important for new users who may have been intimidated by the complex, technical nature of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. \\n We also recognized that, as designers, we wouldn’t be able to do this on our own. Design thinking and the Agile development process encourage communication and collaboration, and we saw that these approaches were key to delivering an outstanding experience for our users alongside a remarkably capable product. \\n The first step was to align with our product management counterparts to develop design roadmaps and research plans. Because our product managers are focused on the users first and work regularly to nurture those relationships, we felt like we had an ongoing open line of communication that made getting feedback from our users easier and faster. \\n Likewise, we partnered with our developers and engineers to completely revamp Watson Assistant’s interaction models. We made a point to work in a more iterative way (we call it The Loop) that encouraged constant feedback and reflection. \\n Until recently, setting up Watson Assistant typically meant that a team of people from a variety of roles would need to play a part. Subject matter experts were needed to provide the material from which Watson Assistant would retrieve its answers. Designers weighed in on branding, interaction patterns, and the overall look and feel. Engineers would take the content and program it as a dialog tree with choices and dead ends, and front-end developers would plug it all into a website’s HTML, CSS, Javascript, and backend architecture. \\n As we were planning the recent improvements, we heard from the people on these teams. They were mostly happy with the end product, but getting to the finish line was typically fraught with problems. If changes needed to be made, they’d have to start the process from the beginning. And for the teams that didn’t have the resources or the staffing to dedicate to every role, things were more complicated and time-consuming. \\n According to our UX Architect Tom Roach, “We needed to find a way to help [users] get to that point radically faster and radically cheaper. They need to be able to build an assistant in a week, not a year.” \\n We made it a priority to design the product so that any person with the subject matter knowledge could build directly in Watson Assistant. The fact is that the people building Watson Assistant and working on it every day are coders and non-coders alike, and we wanted to make it welcoming to users of all disciplines and skill levels. \\n “[Users] need to be able to build an assistant in a week, not a year. “ \\n — UX Architect Tom Roach \\n These people were at the center of our research, our planning, and our designing over the past year plus. From the research, we created personas that represented our stakeholders at every level, and those personas were at the heart of every design decision we made. Every change and every tweak had to be in the best interest of “Tanya”, the subject matter matter expert (and the person building out the content within Watson Assistant), because she had to deliver results for “Cade”, the end user (the person interacting with the chatbot on an organization’s website). Tanya also had to make sure she was able to clearly communicate her successes to the rest of her team: “Paula”, the product manager; “Dinesh”, the data scientist; and “Deb”, the front-end developer. \\n Our user research lead Ashwini Kamath and the rest of the research team sought to build on the work done by teams in Watson Assistant’s past: “We recognized that these [users] were not working by themselves. They were working in partnership with these other people [on their team]. The subject matter expert is the one that has the knowledge … so we should be enabling them. \\n “We did a lot of work around understanding what Tanya’s needs were, what her workflow looked like, what did the collaboration between her and her developer look like. I think, at the heart of it, they realized that the functionality was powerful. We just needed to package it in a way that it would be understandable and usable for a wider audience.” \\n “The subject matter expert is the one that has the knowledge … so we should be enabling them.” \\n — UX research lead Ashwini Kamath \\n With all of these personas in mind and with a great deal of user research and feedback along the way, we’ve made big design and user experience (UX) changes to Watson Assistant so that it’s more user friendly for all types of users; less complicated to get started and to maintain; and easier to extend, integrate, understand, and improve. \\n We want teams and individuals to feel empowered, enabled, and capable when it comes to creating their new assistant. To help with that, we’ve made it easier for users of all experience levels to design and create an assistant in a way that meets their users’ needs as quickly as possible. \\n Users are presented with a dashboard screen that’s been redesigned so that’s it’s easy to track the design and deployment process. It’s now much easier to see what you’ve done and what remains, and it follows the order of the steps we recommend to get your assistant up and running. \\n Watson Assistant now speaks in actions and steps rather than in a tree-based “if-then” system. The process is now akin to writing dialog or scripting a real-life conversation. It’s less complicated and more straightforward for subject matter experts to understand if they choose to (or have to) create their assistant without relying on the help of a developer. \\n We did this because we understand how intimidating topics like machine learning and conditional logic can be for both new and experienced subject matter experts. By making the creation flow feel more like a conversation and less like a logic tree, we hope that assistant creators feel more comfortable and capable when creating the actions and steps their users need. \\n One of the existing features of Watson Assistant that we’ve kept intact is the ability to customize and personalize the look and feel of your assistant without having to write or edit code. \\n We know that creating and launching an assistant from scratch takes time and money. That’s why we’ve included this template built with the same Carbon design system we use internally at IBM. If you can devote fewer resources to coding and deploying your assistant, you’re free to invest more resources in the things that make it your own like the content and the external channel integrations. \\n We heard from users that they wanted the option of seeing their assistant in action without having to go through the process of submitting pull requests and reviewing a litany of small changes. In addition, we wanted subject matter experts to have the freedom to fine tune their content and conversations alongside their assistant instead of having to navigate a codebase or a complex set of if-then statements. \\n At least 85% of users we tested had difficulty telling the difference between the old preview page and the preview panel in our new Actions workflow, so to show Watson Assistant as a true preview, we’ve superimposed the web chat portion of the assistant on a webpage instead of a blank screen. \\n This new preview page takes the assistant you’ve designed and lets you see how it would look and perform. This is where you can easily test and review your conversations, actions, and steps. Once you’re satisfied, you can share your work with others quickly via a public URL. In the coming weeks, we’ll be improving this feature even more: you’ll be able to see what your assistant looks like on your website. \\n For most users, Watson Assistant is more than just a chatbot on a website. Most implementations are connected to other channels like the phone integration, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger. Our users told us that these essential connections weren’t always easy to find, so we added a link directly to the integration catalog if you want to connect (and then preview) additional assistant channels. \\n Early designs that we tested with our users indicated that when an assistant’s live and draft environments were both on the same page in the workflow, users were unclear how the two differed. This drove us to design two separate pages so that users can see clearly where the live environment lives and where the draft environment lives. We tested this and found that all users were able to find both pages and understood that they were separate. This means that once you’re ready to deploy or make changes, you can do so without fear of breaking your assistant. \\n In addition, the new publishing model incorporates versioning, so you can review (or deploy) your changes in both draft and live environments with the option to revert if necessary. We’ve added change tracking as well, and there’s an option to save in-progress changes in case you need to take a break and return later. \\n We’ve also redesigned the analytics dashboard in Watson Assistant to make it much easier to find and fix the gaps in your new assistant. In addition to being able to see how your assistant is performing at a glance, you can now dig deeper into specific conversations and actions to see what’s working and, more importantly, where your users are getting lost or frustrated. \\n The potential complexity of data and analytics can be overwhelming. We sought to make these elements as approachable as possible in order to help subject matter experts make rapid yet effective improvements for their users. A more approachable set of analytics that’s easier to understand and act upon means more opportunities to improve your assistant’s performance. \\n We’ve spent more than a year working on these improvements, and we hope that you’ll both enjoy what we’ve done and help us continue to improve. Give the new Watson Assistant a try and let us know what you think. We’d love your feedback. \\n Thank you to all of the designers (and I would be remiss if I did not also thank those in product management, content, development, marketing and more!) that worked so hard to make this happen! \\n Thanks to Will Fanguy for help with the content and design of this post. \\n \\n  ']\n",

You can build your assistant so it guides each customer along the fastest path to the right solution.\\n{: shortdesc} \\n\\n After your assistant\\'s greeting, each conversation begins with a customer question or request. The first step in guiding your customer to the right solution is for the assistant to recognize what the customer is asking for (based on the example input you have specified), triggering the appropriate action. \\n\\n There are several ways in which the assistant can adapt the conversation to guide the customer down the right path: \\n\\n \\t \\n  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-step-conditions  Step conditions  : Each step in an action can be configured to execute only under certain conditions. Therefore, one action can handle multiple variations of the same issue, depending on conditions at run time. \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-skip-steps  Skipping steps  : Each step in an action can be skipped, if the information it asks for has already been provided. \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-step-what-next  Choosing what to do next  : Instead of executing the steps in an action in sequential order, you can modify the sequence of steps by defining what happens when a step is complete. \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-change-topic  Changing the conversation topic  : Your customer might change the topic of the conversation in the middle of an action. Your assistant can respond to this when appropriate. \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=handle-errors  Handling errors  : Sometimes customers can run into problems getting the assistant to do what they want. You can configure how the assistant recovers from these situations to get back on track. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n By using these mechanisms, you can build an assistant that is flexible and responds dynamically to quickly get your customers to the solutions they need. \\n  ']\n",

Unfortunately, without the amenities of our everyday fitness routines— lavish community gyms, expert personal trainers, even that one buddy who spends way too much time working out— staying in shape can be a struggle for many. \\n But what if you could have 24/7 access to expert-level, on-demand personal training advice, as quickly and easily as sending a text message? Thanks to increasingly sophisticated conversational AI technologies, it’s now possible to build your very own virtual workout advisor in just minutes (even if you have no clue how to code). \\n In this tutorial, we’re going to walk through the process of creating an AI personal trainer using IBM’s Watson Assistant. With a graphical user interface and intuitive mechanisms for mapping dialogue flows, Watson Assistant is one of the most accessible conversational AI platforms on the market, whether you’re a tech-savvy programmer or an ordinary gym-goer. \\n To ensure our bot only gives its users high-quality exercise tips, we’re going to be leveraging the expertise of my friend Stephon Moise, a Florida-based doctor of physical therapy at the helm of WISE Fitness. Stephon has created a repository of home workout advice that will serve as the basis for our bot’s Q&A dialogue flow. \\n Watson Assistant is one of the many services available on IBM’s public cloud platform, so the first step in creating our chatbot is to sign up and log in. \\n This tab will eventually show us the various cloud services we’ve provisioned (including Watson Assistant). Click Create Resource in the upper-right corner. \\n IBM Cloud boasts 170+ products & services, with dozens of data management, AI, and analytics applications, so be sure to check out everything the platform has to offer. \\n Search the IBM Cloud Catalog for Watson Assistant, and create an instance free-of-charge with the Lite plan. \\n You have the ability to create several assistants within a single instance. After creating your first assistant, provide it with a name and an optional description. Finally, click Create Assistant. \\n Assistants interact with users through a collection of behaviors called Skills. Watson Assistant comes with a library of pre-configured skills for a variety of common enterprise uses cases (customer care, for example). In this tutorial, however, we’ll be creating our own. \\n To begin designing our bot’s conversational abilities, click Add dialog skill. \\n Watson Assistant’s dialog skill is comprised of 3 main components: \\n #Intents: An intent is a collection of similar statements expressed by users, typically representing a desired goal or function. For a retail bot, for example, a customer might be seeking #product-info. \\n @Entities: An entity represents a more specific piece of information in a user request, providing detail and context to the overarching intent (perhaps a particular @product in the retail bot example). \\n Dialog: The dialog element provides a graphical outline of how intents and entities interact, mapping each combination to a customized, automated response. \\n Most users will begin interacting with your bot the same way they would interact with a human— by greeting them! Click Create intent and give it the name #Greetings. \\n To help our bot recognize what a typical greeting might look like, we’ll give Watson some examples to train on. Provide at least 5 to 7 variations of common greetings. \\n After analyzing these examples, our bot will not only be able to recognize those specific phrases as #Greetings — thanks to Watson’s core Natural Language Processing capabilities, it will also be able to more readily identify other variations we haven’t trained on. \\n Now that we’ve created our first Intent, let’s integrate it into our bot’s conversational flow by creating a dialog node. Click Dialog on the menu, then click Add Node. Name the node “Greetings,” and under the subheading “If assistant recognizes,” select your #Greetings Intent. \\n Under the “Assistant responds” subheading, script some replies to be triggered whenever your bot detects a greeting. It could seem a little too robotic if your workout assistant responded the same way every time, so give your bot a few different greetings to cycle through! \\n Your customized dialogue updates in real-time, and we can continuously test out our assistant’s conversational capabilities by clicking the Try it button in the upper-right corner. Open up the chat window and say hello! \\n You’ll notice that, below your chat entries, Watson displays the #Greetings classification. If Watson does not recognize your greeting’s Intent, however, the entry will be marked as “Irrelevant.” \\n Luckily, we can train Watson to recognize these unfamiliar greetings right here in the chat window. Try entering a greeting that you did not include in your initial list of examples. If Watson fails to correctly classify it, simply click to open up the classification’s drop-down menu in the chat, and select the #Greetings Intent. Watson will now recognize this phrase in future instances! \\n Note that after some changes, Watson will need time to train. Watson is still training if the following purple message appears at the top of the chat window. Once this message disappears, the dialog results will reflect your latest edits. \\n Now that we’re familiar with how Intents and Dialog nodes work, let’s teach our assistant about fitness! Navigate back to the Intents window, then click Create intent. \\n Choose a common exercise topic that users might want to ask your bot about (for example, “How long should I rest between sets?”). As was the case with our #Greetings Intent, you’ll also need to provide Watson with 3–5 examples of how this type of question might vary. Our example question, with a few variations, might look something like this: \\n How long should I rest between sets? \\n Should I rest before doing another execise? \\n Rest period? \\n Do I need to rest between each set? \\n Once you’re finished building out your first Intent, go ahead and add a few more (check out the WISE Fitness FAQ Page for a full list of ideas). The more Intents and topics your Workout Advisor is able to recognize, the more useful it will be for your users! \\n After you’ve created a collection of new workout-related Intents for your bot to advise users on, return to the Dialog page to integrate them into your conversational flow. Follow the same process from when you creating your Greetings dialog— selecting Add node, identifying the desired Intent, and providing a scripted response. \\n Feel free to pull answers from the WISE Fitness FAQ, or do a bit of research and customize your own answers. The more details your assistant can provide, the better! As you build out each node, continue to test and experiment with your bot in the Try it window, double-checking to ensure that your Q&A’s are working as expected. \\n By now, your Exercise Advisor is capable of fielding quite a few questions, but your Dialog map is probably looking pretty crowded. As the number of Intents grows, it can become difficult to visualize how a conversation with your bot might flow. Let’s clean things up a bit! \\n Click the Add folder button at the top of the Dialog page. \\n After creating the folder and giving it a name (i.e. “General Workout Questions”), move each of your new exercise-related Dialog nodes by clicking the Actions icon (⋮) and selecting Move. Then, click on your folder and select the To Folder option to place your Dialog node inside. \\n Now you can easily reveal/hide this group of Intents by clicking on the folder icon. Much better! \\n So far, we’ve learned how to create basic Q&A dialog flows using some pretty straightforward Intents. But what if our conversation gets a little more complex? \\n Let’s say our user is looking for some personalized workout recommendations. Inherently, this kind of request can’t be answered with a simple Q&A structure. There’s more context that you need to understand— what kind of equipment do they have available? What muscle group are they targeting? Without getting a little more background, your bot won’t be able to offer a high-quality response. \\n This is where context variables come in. Watson uses context variables to store this kind of situational input (provided by either the user or an external plugin) in order to create a more specific, customized response. \\n Before we create our context variables, however, we’ll need to build out the corresponding Intent and Entities. Begin by creating a “workout recommendations” Intent (i.e. #WorkoutRecs). Follow the same process as before, and include a few variations with alternative phrasings. \\n Sample utterances of this Intent might include: \\n Can you recommend some exercises? \\n What workouts can I do? \\n Any exercise recommendations for a home workout? \\n I need recommendations for my workouts! \\n Next, we’ll add an Entity to help further specify the context of our workout recommendations. In this case, we’ll categorize each exercise by the targeted muscle group. For the sake of simplicity, in this tutorial, we’ll only define 2 broad muscle groups (upper and lower body). Feel free to return to this step later on to create additional muscle groups (and other contextual categories like equipment) to help fine-tune your bot’s recommendation engine. \\n To begin, click Create entity and provide it with the name @musclegroup. \\n Then, name your first @musclegroup value “upper body.” Under the synonyms field, list a series of muscles that would fall into the upper body category (arms, chest, shoulders, etc.). Also include alternative ways that users might phrase the “upper body” category (upper, torso, top half). \\n Once you’re finished listing possible ways a user might request workout recommendations for the “upper body” category, click Add value. Then, repeat this process for the “lower body” value. Provide both muscle names (quads, glutes, calves) and alternative category names (lower, legs, bottom half). \\n Navigate back to the Dialog page and click Add node. Under “If assistant recognizes,” select your #WorkoutRecs Intent. \\n Because we want to differentiate our recommendations based on the desired muscle group, we’ll need to customize this node a little further. Click Customize in the upper right corner of the node, then turn on the Slots and Multiple conditioned responses options. \\n Slots give your bot the ability to collect and store user input. In this case, our slot will store our target muscle group. \\n Multiple conditioned responses will allow you to use the input you’ve captured in your slots to offer different responses, depending on the context. \\n Remember context variables? We’re now going to use our slot to capture the user’s muscle group input (in the form of an Entity) and store it in one of these variables. Context variables are denoted with the $ prefix. \\n Under the Then check for section, fill out the text fields as follows: \\n Check for: @musclegroup \\n Save it as: $musclegroup \\n If not present, ask: What muscle group would you like to work out? \\n Now, the bot should be able to prompt the user for a target muscle group (if not initially provided), then store this information as a context variable for later use in the conversation. \\n You can see your context variable in action by clicking the Try it window and chatting with your bot. After requesting a workout recommendation for “arms,” click Manage Context in the upper right corner. Your bot has stored this input as $musclegroup = upper body! \\n It’s finally time to script exercise recommendations! Scroll down to the Assistant Responds section of your node and click Add response to bring the total number of potential responses to 2. Then, fill out each field as follows: \\n If assistant recognizes: $musclegroup:(upper body) \\n Respond with: For upper body exercises at home, here are a few options you can try: <br/>- Push-Ups (Chest) <br/>- Dips (Triceps) <br/>- Planks (Shoulders) \\n AND \\n If assistant recognizes: $musclegroup:(lower body) \\n Respond with: For lower body exercises at home, here are a few options you can try: <br/> - Body Weight Squat (Hamstrings/Quads) <br/> - Lunges (Hamstrings/Quads) <br/> - Toe Raises (Calves) \\n The <br/> symbol included in the two examples above is what is known as a “break” element in HTML. This particular element allows you to separate your text into sequential lines. There are many other ways you can format your bot’s responses using HTML tags, for example: \\n Feel free to get creative with the look and feel of your bot’s responses— unique formatting can be a great way of injecting a little more personality into the conversation! \\n While testing your bot, one thing you may notice is that context variables are stored for the entire conversation, by default. This can present some issues. For example, if your user asks for upper body workout recommendations, then follows up to ask about recommendations for a different muscle group, your bot will assume they’re still requesting information from the upper body category. \\n Bot: Hello. How can I help you? \\n User: Can you provide me with some workout recommendations? \\n Bot: What muscle group would you like to work out? \\n User: Upper body. \\n Bot: For upper body exercises at home, here are a few options you can try… \\n User: Any recommended exercises for other muscle groups? \\n Bot: For upper body exercises at home, here are a few options you can try… \\n What the bot should do is make another request for a target muscle group. Because the “upper body” context variable is still being stored, however, the bot is unable to recognize the new scope of this question. \\n To address this concern, we’ll construct a Child node to clear our conversation’s context after exercise recommendations are provided. \\n Click the Actions icon (⋮) on your “Workout Recommendations” node, then click Add child node. Name this new node “Clear Context.” Under “If assistant recognizes,” select your $musclegroup context variable. Then, click the Actions icon (⋮) next to the “Assistant responds” section, and open up the Context Editor. \\n After the Context Editor is opened, enter the following values into the fields: \\n Variable: musclegroup \\n Value: null \\n This will clear the $musclegroup variable of any stored values once the node is activated. \\n Finally, under “Assistant responds,” add a friendly follow-up message (“Let me know if you have any other questions!”), inviting the user to make additional queries. \\n In order to trigger our “Clear Context” actions, we’ll have to connect it to our “Workout Recommendations” node. \\n Click back over to the “Workout Recommendations” node, and scroll down to the bottom. Underneath the “Then assistant should” section, select Jump to from the dropdown menu. Finally, click the “Clear Context” node, and select Respond. \\n Your bot’s workout recommendation capabilities should be ready to do some heavy lifting! But one last thing… \\n The most important rule in building a chatbot? Make sure people know they’re interacting with one. From the very beginning of the conversation, users should know there’s not a human on the other end of the line. This sets reasonable expectations for what sort of questions your bot can answer, and helps users feel you’re being transparent about your use of an automated system. \\n Click the Welcome node to begin editing your intro message. Here’s a sample greeting to get you started: \\n Hi there! My name is Flex. I’m a chatbot, and your very own personal workout assistant! I can help answer basic questions about fitness and provide exercise recommendations. What can I do for you today? \\n Congrats— your virtual workout advisor should now be ready for the big leagues! Navigate back to the Assistants page to access your bot’s preview link, and give it a spin.

Click the <strong>Customer starts with</strong> box in the upper-left to go back to this and add some alternate ways to phrase the question.</p>\\n<p> <img alt=\"Alternate phrasing for question\" src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/developer/default/tutorials/create-your-first-assistant-powered-chatbot/images/alternate-phrases-for-hours.png\"/></p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>Click the Save icon in the upper right because this must be saved to use the Preview widget. If you click on the gear icon for the Assistant settings, you see that auto-save is on, but it performs this save when you switch between steps. Now, test again in the preview window by typing something like <code style=\"font-family:monospace;font-size:1rem\">open</code> that is present in your list of phrases. You should get a correct response.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>Notice in the preview window that the bot ends with \"There are no additional steps for this action. Add a new step or end the action.\" Let\\'s end the action. Go back to the Conversation step by clicking on it in the upper-left corner, and change the <em>And then</em> dropdown to <strong>End the action</strong>.</p>\\n<p> <img alt=\"Change to end the action\" src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/developer/default/tutorials/create-your-first-assistant-powered-chatbot/images/change-to-end-the-action.png\"/></p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>Save your changes, and reset the Preview.

The conditions should prepopulate with <em>\"1. All of this is true: If </em>We have 2 locations...\"<em> is <code style=\"font-family:monospace;font-size:1rem\">Downtown</code>. You can click around and see that you can change the logic in various ways, from </em>is<em> to </em>is not<em> or from </em>All<em> of this is true to </em>Any<em>. You can add more conditions or an entire group of conditions. Now, you can add an answer under </em>Assistant says* such as \"Our Downtown location is at 3210 Main St., and the phone number is 303-867-5309\".</p>\\n<p> <img alt=\"Add location conditions\" src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/developer/default/tutorials/create-your-first-assistant-powered-chatbot/images/location-conditions.png\"/></p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>You can add a similar condition for If <code style=\"font-family:monospace;font-size:1rem\">We have 2 locations</code> is <code style=\"font-family:monospace;font-size:1rem\">Riverside</code>. After saving, test the bot in the Preview widget to make sure that it works as expected. In the following example, I ask \"what are your locations?\", but I haven\\'t added any alternatives. The Watson Assistant disambiguation feature displays a question for clarification, \"Did you mean?\" along with options for my actions. I can click \"Where are you located?\" or enter the text and get the wanted response.

One part of each step is what the assistant says to the customer when the step is processed. \\n\\n To create your assistant\\'s response in a step, you use the  Assistant says  section. This represents the text or speech the assistant delivers to a user at a particular step. Depending on the step, you can add a complete answer to a user\\'s question or ask a follow-up question. \\n\\n You can enter a simple text response just by entering the text that you want your assistant to display to the user. You can also add formatting and web content, and you can reference user information using  variables . \\n\\n Formatting responses \\n\\n {: #respond-formatting} \\n\\n Use the text editor tools to apply font styling, such as bold or italic, to the text or to add links. \\n\\n Behind the scenes, font styling and link syntax are stored in Markdown format. If you are using the web chat integration, HTML and Markdown tagging are supported (for more information, see  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture#web-chat-architecture-markdown Markdown formatting ). \\n\\n HTML tags (except for links) are automatically removed from text responses that are sent to the Facebook, WhatsApp, and Slack integrations, because those channels do not support HTML formatting. HTML tags are still handled appropriately in channels that support them (such as the web chat) and stored in the session history. \\n\\n\\n\\n If you\\'re using a custom client application that does not support Markdown, don\\'t apply text styling to your text responses.\\n{: note} \\n\\n Adding and referencing variables \\n\\n {: #respond-variables} \\n\\n During the conversation, your assistant stores information as  variables . Variables are containers for data values that become available at run time; the value of a variable can change over time. Variables include  action variables , which persist only during a particular action, and  session variables , which are available to any action. For more information about variables, see  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info Managing information during the conversation . \\n\\n In your assistant\\'s output, you can reference variables in order to personalize the conversation or include information that is available at run time. For more information about referencing variables in what your assistant says, see  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info#reference-variables Using variables to customize the conversation . \\n\\n Testing responses \\n\\n {: #respond-testing} \\n\\n To see if the assistant responses are formatted correctly, you can use  Preview . \\n\\n \\t Click the  Preview  button. \\n\\t To start the action, enter your first phrase, for example:  What are your store hours? . \\n\\t When the assistant responds, check that the message displays as you intended with formatting, use of variables, and so on. \\n \\n\\n Tips for adding responses \\n\\n {: #respond-tips-responses} \\n\\n \\t Keep answers short and useful. \\n\\t Reflect the user\\'s intent in the response. Doing so assures users that the bot is understanding them, or if it is not, gives users a chance to correct a misunderstanding immediately. \\n\\t Only include links to external sites in responses if the answer depends on data that changes frequently. \\n\\t Word your responses carefully. You can change how someone reacts to your system based simply on how you phrase a response. Changing one line of text can prevent you from having to write multiple lines of code to implement a complex programmatic solution. \\n \\n\\n Adding variations \\n\\n {: #respond-variations} \\n\\n If your users return to your assistant frequently, they might be bored to see the same greetings and responses every time. You can add  response variations  so that your assistant can respond to the same request in different ways. \\n\\n You can choose to rotate through the response variations sequentially or in random order. By default, responses are rotated sequentially, as if they were chosen from an ordered list. \\n\\n To add response variations: \\n\\n \\t \\n In  Assistant says , click the  Add response variations  icon  Add response variations images/response-variations-icon.png  . \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n For  Response variation type , choose whether to rotate through the response variations sequentially or in random order. For more information see  rect #respond-variations-sequential-random Sequential or random . \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  Response variations images/response-variations-modal.png  {: caption=\"Response variations\" caption-side=\"bottom\"} \\n\\n \\t Add each variation into its own field. For example: \\n \\n\\n | Response number | Variation |\\n   | -- | -- |\\n   | Response 1 | How can I help you? |\\n   | Response 2 | What can I do for you today? |\\n   | Response 3 | Tell me what I can help with. |\\n   | Response 4 | Can I help you? |\\n{: caption=\"Response variation examples\" caption-side=\"bottom\"} \\n\\n \\t When you\\'re finished, click  Apply . The variations appear as a block inside  Assistant says . You can click the  Edit  icon to update the variations, or click the  Delete  icon to remove all the variations. Also, you can add multiple sets of response variations to a step. \\n \\n\\n  Response variations in Assistant says images/response-variations-assistant-says.png  {: caption=\"Response variations in Assistant says\" caption-side=\"bottom\"} \\n\\n Sequential or random \\n\\n {: #respond-variations-sequential-random} \\n\\n For  Response variation type , you can choose  Sequential  or  Random . \\n\\n  Sequential  returns the first response variation the first time the action is triggered, the second response variation the second time the action is triggered, and so on, in the same order as you entered the variations. This results in responses being returned in the following order when the node is processed: \\n\\n \\t First time: \\n \\n\\n  screen\\n   How can I help you?  \\n\\n \\t Second time: \\n \\n\\n  screen\\n   What can I do for you today?  \\n\\n \\t Third time: \\n \\n\\n  screen\\n   Tell me what I can help with.  \\n\\n \\t Fourth time: \\n \\n\\n  screen\\n   Can I help you?  \\n\\n  Random  selects variation the first time the action is triggered, and randomly selects another variation the next time, but without repeating the same variation consecutively. Here\\'s an example of the order that responses might appear: \\n\\n \\t First time: \\n \\n\\n  screen\\n   Tell me what I can help with.  \\n\\n \\t Second time: \\n \\n\\n  screen\\n   Can I help you?  \\n\\n \\t Third time: \\n \\n\\n  screen\\n   How can I help you?  \\n\\n \\t Fourth time: \\n \\n\\n  screen\\n   What can I do for you today?  \\n\\n Media responses \\n\\n {: #respond-response-types} \\n\\n In addition to text responses, you can use other  response types  to send responses that include multimedia or interactive elements.  \\n\\n The action editor supports the following media response types: \\n\\n \\t  Image : Embeds an image into the response. The source image file must be hosted somewhere and have a URL that you can use to reference it. It cannot be a file that is stored in a directory that is not publicly accessible. \\n\\t  Video : Embeds a video player into the response. The source video must be hosted somewhere, either as a playable video on a supported video streaming service or as a video file with a URL that you can use to reference it. It cannot be a file that is stored in a directory that is not publicly accessible. \\n\\t  Audio : Embeds an audio clip into the response. The source audio file must be hosted somewhere and have a URL that you can use to reference it. It cannot be a file that is stored in a directory that is not publicly accessible. \\n\\t  iframe : Embeds content from an external website, such as a form or other interactive component, directly within the chat. The source content must be publicly accessible using HTTP, and must be embeddable as an HTML  iframe  element. \\n \\n\\n Different channel integrations have different capabilities for displaying media responses. To see which channel integrations support which response types, see  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-assistant-responses-json-integration-support Channel integration support for response types . \\n\\n If you want to define different responses that are customized for different channels, you can do so by editing the response using the JSON editor. For more information, see  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-assistant-responses-json#assistant-responses-json-target-integrations Targeting specific integrations . \\n\\n By editing your responses using the JSON editor, you can also access additional response types for handling channel-specific interactions. \\n\\n For more information about how to edit responses using the JSON editor, see  rect /docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-assistant-responses-json Defining responses using the JSON editor .\\n{: note} \\n\\n Adding an  Image  response \\n\\n {: #respond-add-image} \\n\\n Add an  Image  response to display an image to the customer. \\n\\n The  Image  response type is supported by the following channel integrations:\\n- Web chat\\n- SMS\\n- Slack\\n- Microsoft Teams\\n- Facebook\\n- WhatsApp \\n\\n To add an  Image  response, complete the following steps: \\n\\n \\t \\n In the  Assistant says  field, click the  Image images/image-response.png    Image  icon. \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n In the  Source URL  field, type the full URL to the hosted image. \\n\\n The image must be in  .jpg ,  .gif , or  .png  format. The image file must be stored in a location that is publicly addressable by an  https:  URL (such as  https://www.example.com/assets/common/logo.png ). \\n\\n To access an image that is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}, enable public access to the individual image storage object, and then reference it by specifying the image source with syntax like this:  https://s3.eu.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/your-bucket-name/image-name.png . \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n Optionally specify an image title, description, and alt text in the fields provided. In the web chat integration, the title and description are displayed along with the image. \\n\\n References to variables are not supported. Some integration channels ignore titles or descriptions.\\n{: note} \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n Click  Apply . \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n Adding an  Audio  response \\n\\n {: #respond-add-audio} \\n\\n Add an  Audio  response to include spoken-word or other audible content.

Some integration channels ignore titles or descriptions.\\n{: note} \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n Adding a  Video  response \\n\\n {: #respond-add-video} \\n\\n Add a  Video  response to display a how-to demonstration, promotional clip, or other video content. In the web chat, a video response renders as an embedded video player. \\n\\n The  Video  response type is supported by the following channel integrations:\\n- Web chat\\n- SMS\\n- Slack\\n- Facebook\\n- WhatsApp \\n\\n To add a  Video  response, complete the following steps: \\n\\n \\t \\n In the  Assistant says  field, click the  Video images/video-response.png    Video  icon. \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n In the  Source URL  field, type the full URL to the hosted video: \\n\\n \\t To link directly to a video file, specify the URL to a file in any standard format such as MPEG or AVI. In the web chat, the linked video will render as an embedded video player. \\n \\n\\n HLS ( .m3u8 ) and DASH (MPD) streaming videos are not supported.\\n  {: note} \\n\\n \\t To link to a video hosted on a supported video hosting service, specify the URL to the video. In the web chat, the linked video will render using the embeddable player for the hosting service. \\n \\n\\n Specify the URL you would use to view the video in your browser (for example,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52bpMKVigGU ). You do not need to convert the URL to an embeddable form; the web chat will do this automatically.\\n  {: note} \\n\\n You can embed videos hosted on the following services:\\n  -  rect https://youtube.com YouTube {: external}\\n  -  rect https://facebook.com Facebook {: external}\\n  -  rect https://vimeo.com Vimeo {: external}\\n  -  rect https://twitch.tv Twitch {: external}\\n  -  rect https://streamable.com Streamable {: external}\\n  -  rect https://wistia.com Wistia {: external}\\n  -  rect https://vidyard.com Vidyard {: external} \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n Optionally specify a video title, description, and alt text in the fields provided. In the web chat integration, the title and description are displayed along with the video player. \\n\\n References to variables are not supported. Some integration channels ignore titles or descriptions.\\n{: note} \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n If you want to scale the video to a specific display size, specify a number in the  Base height  field. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n Adding an  iframe  response \\n\\n {: #respond-add-iframe} \\n\\n Add an  iframe  response to embed content from another website directly inside the chat window as an HTML  iframe  element. An iframe response is useful if you want to enable customers to perform some interaction with an external service without leaving the chat. For example, you might use an  iframe  response to display the following within the web chat: \\n\\n \\t An interactive map on  rect https://www.google.com/maps Google Maps {: external} \\n\\t A survey using  rect https://www.surveymonkey.com/ SurveyMonkey {: external} \\n\\t A form for making reservations through  rect https://www.opentable.com/ OpenTable {: external} \\n\\t A scheduling form using  rect https://calendly.com/ Calendly {: external} \\n \\n\\n In the web chat, an iframe response renders as a preview card that describes the embedded content. Customers can click this card to display the frame and interact with the content. \\n\\n The  iframe  response type is supported by the following channel integrations:\\n- Web chat\\n- Facebook \\n\\n To add an  iframe  response type, complete the following steps: \\n\\n \\t \\n In the  Assistant says  field, click the  iframe images/iframe-response.png    iframe  icon. \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n Add the full URL to the external content in the  iframe source  field. \\n\\n The URL must specify content that is embeddable in an HTML  iframe  element. Different sites have different restrictions for embedding content, and different processes for generating embeddable URLs. An embeddable URL is one that can be specified as the value of the  src  attribute of the  iframe  element. \\n\\n For example, to embed an interactive map using Google Maps, you can use the Google Maps Embed API. (For more information, see  rect https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-started The Maps Embed API overview {: external}.) Other sites have different processes for creating embeddable content. \\n\\n For technical details about using  Content-Security-Policy: frame-src  to allow embedding of your website content, see  rect https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-src CSP: frame-src {: external}. \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n Optionally add a descriptive title in the  Title  field. \\n\\n In the web chat, this title will be displayed in the preview card that the customer clicks to render the external content. (If you do not specify a title, the web chat will attempt to retrieve metadata from the specified URL and display the title of the content as specified at the source.) \\n\\n References to variables are not supported.\\n{: note} \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n Technical details: <iframe> sandboxing \\n\\n Content loaded in an iframe by the web chat is  sandboxed , meaning that it has restricted permissions that reduce security vulnerabilities. The web chat uses the  sandbox  attribute of the  iframe  element to grant only the following permissions: \\n\\n | Permission          | Description |\\n|---------------------|-------------|\\n|  allow-downloads    | Allows downloading files from the network, if the download is initiated by the user. |\\n|  allow-forms        | Allows submitting forms. |\\n|  allow-scripts      | Allows running scripts, but  not  opening pop-up windows. |\\n|  allow-same-origin  | Allows the content to access its own data storage (such as cookies), and allows only very limited access to JavaScript APIs. | \\n\\n A script running inside a sandboxed iframe cannot make changes to any content content outside the iframe,  if  the outer page and the iframe have different origins. Be careful if you use an  iframe  response to embed content that has the same origin as the the page where your web chat widget is hosted; in this situation the embedded content can defeat the sandboxing and gain access to content outside the frame. For more information about this potential vulnerability, see the  sandbox  attribute  rect https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-sandbox documentation {: external}.\\n{: note} \\n\\n Pause response \\n\\n {: #respond-pause-response} \\n\\n Use a  Pause  response to have your assistant wait for a specified interval before displaying the next response. This pause might be to allow time for a request to complete, or simply to mimic the appearance of a live agent who might pause between responses. The pause can be of any duration from 1 to 10 seconds. \\n\\n A  Pause  response is typically used in combination with other responses. By default, a typing indicator animation appears during the pause in order to simulate a live agent. \\n\\n The  Pause  response type is supported by the following channel integrations:\\n- Web chat\\n- Facebook\\n- WhatsApp \\n\\n With the phone channel, you can add a pause by including the SSML  break  element in the assistant output. For more information, see the  rect /docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-elements#break_element {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} documentation {: external}.\\n{: note} \\n\\n To add a  Pause  response: \\n\\n \\t \\n In the  Assistant says  field, click the  Pause images/pause.png    Pause  icon.  \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n In the   Duration  field, enter the length of time for the pause to last as a number of seconds. \\n\\n The duration can\\'t exceed 10 seconds. Customers are typically willing to wait about 8 seconds for someone to enter a response.  \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n The  Typing indicator  is set to  On  by default. You can set this to  Off  if you want. \\n\\n Add another response type, such as a text response type, after the pause to clearly denote that the pause is over.\\n{: tip} \\n\\n \\n \\n  ']\n"
